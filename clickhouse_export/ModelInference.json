Here\u2019s how to ensure it's set up correctly:\\n\\n1. **Check Browser Compatibility**:\\n   - Make sure you are using a supported browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). \\n   \\n2. **Verify the Extension is Enabled**:\\n   - Look for the Grammarly icon in your browser's toolbar. If it\u2019s grayed out, click on it to enable it for Notion.\\n\\n3. **Refresh Notion**:\\n   - Sometimes, a simple refresh of the Notion page can activate Grammarly features. Press `F5` or click the refresh button in your browser.\\n\\n4. **Check Settings**:\\n   - In the Grammarly extension settings, ensure that \\\"Enable for all sites\\\" is checked.\\n\\n### 2. **Using Grammarly in a Separate Document**\\nIf the above does not work for some reason, you can copy your text into a separate document, such as Google Docs or a Word document, where Grammarly provides full support. Here\u2019s what to do:\\n\\n1. **Open Google Docs or Word**:\\n   - Paste your text there and let Grammarly check it.\\n\\n2. **Make Corrections**:\\n   - Go through Grammarly\u2019s suggestions and make any necessary corrections.\\n\\n3. **Copy Back to Notion**:\\n   - Once you\u2019ve finished editing, copy the corrected text back into Notion.\\n\\n### Additional Suggestions\\n- **Update Your Browser and Extension**: Ensure both your browser and the Grammarly extension are up to date.\\n- **Restart Your Browser**: Sometimes, simply closing and reopening your browser can resolve minor issues.\\n- **Clear Cache**: If you experience persistent issues, clearing your browser's cache can sometimes help.\\n\\nIf you still run into problems or if Grammarly isn't working as expected in Notion, feel free to reach out again.

While there isn't a direct way to merge two Grammarly accounts, I can guide you on how to manage the situation effectively. Here\u2019s what you can do:\\n\\n### Steps to Manage Your Grammarly Accounts:\\n\\n1. **Determine Which Account You Want to Keep**: Decide which account has your current subscription, saved documents, or any other information you want to retain.\\n\\n2. **Export Your Documents**: \\n   - Log into the account you want to give up.\\n   - Copy and save any important documents or content you want to keep. Unfortunately, Grammarly doesn\u2019t have a built-in export feature for all documents, so you may need to copy and paste them into a new document.\\n\\n3. **Cancel the Unwanted Account**:\\n   - Go to the **Grammarly account settings**.\\n   - Select the **Billing** tab.\\n   - From there, follow the prompts to cancel your subscription if necessary.\\n\\n4. **Log in to Your Preferred Account**: Make sure you can access your preferred account and all necessary services are active there.\\n\\n5. **Contact Support (if needed)**: If you encounter any issues or if you have questions about your subscription status, please reach out to Grammarly's support team. You can do this by clicking on the **Help Center** from the Grammarly website and submitting a ticket for more tailored assistance.\\n\\n### Additional Tips:\\n- Ensure that the email addresses tied to both accounts are accessible so you can confirm any changes.\\n- If you\u2019re trying to figure out which account has a paid subscription, check your billing history for both accounts.\\n\\n### Next Steps:\\nIf you need further assistance or have any more queries about your individual accounts, please feel free to ask. I\u2019m here to help!\"}]", "cached": false, "finish_reason": "stop"}

If there\u2019s an update, go ahead and install it.\\n4. For the Grammarly app, open the **Mac App Store** and check if an update is available in the **Updates** tab.\\n\\n### Step 3: Clear Cache and Preferences\\nClearing the cache and resetting preferences can resolve issues with the app:\\n1. Close Grammarly if it\u2019s open.\\n2. Open Finder and click on **Go** in the top menu.\\n3. Hold down the **Option** key and select **Library** from the dropdown.\\n4. Navigate to **Caches** and find the Grammarly folder. Move it to the Trash.\\n5. Go back to the **Library** folder, then to **Preferences**, and look for any files related to Grammarly. Move them to the Trash as well.\\n6. Restart your Mac and try opening the app again.\\n\\n### Step 4: Reinstall Grammarly\\nIf the app still won\u2019t open, reinstalling it could help:\\n1. Open **Finder** and go to the **Applications** folder.\\n2. Find **Grammarly** and drag it to the Trash.\\n3. Open the **Mac App Store**, search for Grammarly, and reinstall it.\\n\\n### Additional Troubleshooting\\nIf none of these steps work, please check the following:\\n- Ensure that you have sufficient disk space on your Mac.\\n- Check if there are any security settings (like your firewall) restricting the app from opening.\\n\\nIf you've gone through these steps and the app still won't open, I recommend reaching out to our human support team for further assistance. You can do this through the help section of the Grammarly website, where you can submit a request.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n1. Try the above steps and see if the app opens.\\n2.

Find Grammarly in the search results, click on it, and then select **Add** or **Install**.\\n   - **For Mac**:\\n     1. Open Microsoft Word and navigate to the **Insert** menu.\\n     2. Choose **Add-ins**.\\n     3. Use the search function to find \u201cGrammarly\u201d and install it.\\n\\n4. **Enable the Grammarly Add-In**:\\n   - Once installed, if the icon doesn\u2019t appear, restart Microsoft Word.\\n   - The Grammarly add-in should now be active. Click on the Grammarly icon to open the sidebar.\\n\\n5. **Log in to Grammarly**: If prompted, log in with your Grammarly account credentials.\\n\\n### Additional Tips:\\n- **Update Microsoft Word**: Ensure that your Microsoft Word is up to date, as outdated versions can sometimes cause issues with add-ins.\\n- **Check if the Add-In is Disabled**: Sometimes, Word disables add-ins that are not functioning correctly. To check this:\\n  - Go to **File** > **Options** > **Add-ins**.\\n  - Look for Grammarly in the list of inactive add-ins. If it\u2019s there, select it and click **Enable**.\\n\\n### Next Steps:\\nAfter following these steps, you should see Grammarly working in Microsoft Word. If you still encounter issues, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out again. Providing the version of Microsoft Word you are using and your operating system can also help us troubleshoot further.\\n\\nIf the problem persists after these steps, I can assist in escalating this to our support team for more detailed help.
