Here’s how to ensure it's set up correctly:\n\n1. **Check Browser Compatibility**:\n   - Make sure you are using a supported browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). \n   \n2. **Verify the Extension is Enabled**:\n   - Look for the Grammarly icon in your browser's toolbar. If it’s grayed out, click on it to enable it for Notion.\n\n3. **Refresh Notion**:\n   - Sometimes, a simple refresh of the Notion page can activate Grammarly features. Press `F5` or click the refresh button in your browser.\n\n4. **Check Settings**:\n   - In the Grammarly extension settings, ensure that \""Enable for all sites\"" is checked.\n\n### 2. **Using Grammarly in a Separate Document**\nIf the above does not work for some reason, you can copy your text into a separate document, such as Google Docs or a Word document, where Grammarly provides full support. Here’s what to do:\n\n1. **Open Google Docs or Word**:\n   - Paste your text there and let Grammarly check it.\n\n2. **Make Corrections**:\n   - Go through Grammarly’s suggestions and make any necessary corrections.\n\n3. **Copy Back to Notion**:\n   - Once you’ve finished editing, copy the corrected text back into Notion.\n\n### Additional Suggestions\n- **Update Your Browser and Extension**: Ensure both your browser and the Grammarly extension are up to date.\n- **Restart Your Browser**: Sometimes, simply closing and reopening your browser can resolve minor issues.\n- **Clear Cache**: If you experience persistent issues, clearing your browser's cache can sometimes help.\n\nIf you still run into problems or if Grammarly isn't working as expected in Notion, feel free to reach out again.

If it's unchecked, check it and click **OK**.\n\n3. **Update Microsoft Office**:\n   - An outdated version of Microsoft Office may cause compatibility issues. To update:\n     - Open any Office application (like Word or Excel).\n     - Go to the **File** menu, select **Account**, and click on **Update Options** > **Update Now**.\n\n4. **Restart PowerPoint and Your Computer**:\n   - Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve issues. Close PowerPoint completely and restart your computer to ensure that changes take effect.\n\n5. **Clear Cache** (if issues persist):\n   - Clearing cache can be helpful:\n     - Close all Office applications.\n     - Open the Run dialog by pressing `Windows + R`.\n     - Type `%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Office\\` and press **Enter**.\n     - Look for the **Office** folder and delete any temporary files if present.\n\n6. **Reinstall Grammarly Add-in**:\n   - If Grammarly still isn't working, consider removing and reinstalling the add-in:\n     - Go to **Insert** > **Get Add-ins**, find Grammarly, and choose to remove it.\n     - Follow step 1 to reinstall it from the add-ins store.\n\n### After Trying These Steps:\nOnce you've completed these steps, please check if Grammarly is now detecting errors in your PowerPoint presentations. If the issue persists, let me know, and I can escalate this to our support team for further assistance.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Make sure you're logged into the Grammarly account that has access to the business features.\n- Verify if the text you're typing has enough content for Grammarly to analyze—sometimes, minimal text may lead to it not detecting issues.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!""}]","","{""chat_completion"":{}}",9689,"{}","[]",\N

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n1. **Verify Your Eligibility**:\n   - Ensure that your institution is part of the Grammarly Edu program and eligible for student discounts. You can check this on Grammarly's website under the Edu section.\n\n2. **Check Your Email Verification**:\n   - Make sure that you are using your school email address for registration. Sometimes, discounts are not applied if the email isn’t verified.\n\n3. **Reapply the Discount**:\n   - If you’ve recently changed your email address or institution, you may need to reapply for the student discount:\n     - Log in to your Grammarly account.\n     - Go to the subscription page.\n     - Look for the section that allows you to apply or reapply the student discount.\n\n4. **Refresh or Reinstall**:\n   - If you’re using the Grammarly browser extension, try refreshing the page or restarting your browser. If the issue persists, consider reinstalling the extension.\n\n5. **Check for Any Ongoing Issues**:\n   - Sometimes, there may be temporary system issues. Check Grammarly's status page or social media accounts to see if they’ve reported any known problems affecting discounts.\n\nIf you’ve tried these steps and still don’t see the correct discount being applied, it may be best to reach out to our support team for further assistance. They can look into your account details more closely.\n\nAs a next step:\n- You can submit a support request through Grammarly's Help Center or reply here with your account details so I can assist you further, but please avoid sharing sensitive information.\n\nThank you for your patience, and I hope this helps!

Try opening a web page or another app to confirm this.\n   \n2. **Sign Out and Back In**:\n   - Sometimes, simply signing out of your Grammarly account and then signing back in can resolve syncing issues.\n   - On the app or website, go to your account settings and select “Sign Out.” Once signed out, sign back in.\n\n3. **Update Your App**:\n   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Grammarly app on your devices. \n     - For **iOS** and **Android**: Check the App Store or Google Play Store for updates.\n     - For **Windows** and **Mac**: Grammarly should prompt for updates, but you can also check for updates in the app settings.\n\n4. **Clear Cache and Data** (if you're using the app):\n   - For **iOS**: Go to Settings > General > [App Name] and select “Delete App.” Then, reinstall it from the App Store.\n   - For **Android**: Go to Settings > Apps > Grammarly > Storage > Clear Cache and Clear Data. Restart the app afterward.\n   - For **Windows**: In the app, go to Settings and look for options to clear the app data or cache.\n\n5. **Try Another Device or Browser**:\n   - If possible, try accessing your account from another device or browser to see if the documents show up there. This helps to identify if the problem is device-specific.\n\n6. **Check Your Account**:\n   - Make sure you’re signed into the same Grammarly account on all devices. Sometimes, syncing issues arise from using different accounts.\n\n### If the Problem Persists:\nIf you've tried all these steps and are still facing syncing issues, please let me know the following:\n\n- The browser and version you are using (if applicable).\n- The operating system of the devices you're using (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android).\n  \nThis information will help us further diagnose the problem, and I may need to escalate the issue to our technical team for specific assistance.\n\n### Next Steps:\nPlease attempt the above steps, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any additional questions or updates.

Note that this will remove any custom words you've added, but it may help with the crashing.\n\n5. **Check for Other Conflicting Apps**: If other keyboards or third-party applications are causing conflicts, try disabling them temporarily.\n   - Go to **Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards** and remove any keyboards you don't need.\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and the Grammarly keyboard continues to crash, please let me know. We may need to look into this further, and I can help escalate your issue to our technical support team for more assistance.\n\nAs a follow-up, if you could provide the version of your iOS and the Grammarly app you're using, that would be helpful for further troubleshooting.\n\nThank you for your patience, and I hope we can resolve this issue quickly!""}]","","{""chat_completion"":{}}",10838,"{}","[]",\N

Code comments often contain specific jargon or syntax that may not align with Grammarly's usual parameters for checking.\n\nHere are a few options you might consider for ensuring your code comments are clear and effective:\n\n1. **Copy Comments into Grammarly's Editor**: If you want to check the clarity of your comments, you can copy and paste them into the Grammarly editor. This way, you can still benefit from Grammarly's suggestions.\n\n2. **Use Comments for Clarity**: While writing comments, focus on being concise and clear. You might want to explain the \""why\"" behind the code rather than just the \""what.\"" This can make your comments more effective even without Grammarly's help.\n\n3. **Look for Feedback Tools for Code**: There are specialized tools and extensions designed for checking code quality and commenting best practices. Consider looking into coding environments that integrate these features.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help with something else, feel free to let me know!""}]","","{""chat_completion"":{}}",6327,"{}","[]",\N

For example, some editors like Visual Studio Code have Grammarly extensions that can help you check your Markdown content.\n\n3. **Browser Extension**: If you're writing Markdown in an online platform (like a CMS or collaborative editor), make sure to have the Grammarly browser extension enabled. This will help you catch grammar and spelling errors as you write.\n\n### Suggestions for Feature Request:\n\nIf you’d like to officially request Markdown support, you can visit the Grammarly feedback page. Your input is valuable, and the product team considers user suggestions for future updates.

Let’s work on resolving this issue with the Grammarly browser extension conflicting with others.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting:\n\n1. **Disable Other Extensions**:\n   - Temporarily disable other extensions to see if Grammarly starts working again.\n   - In Chrome/Edge: Click on the three-dot menu in the top right corner and select \""More tools\"" > \""Extensions.\"" Toggle off other extensions.\n   - In Firefox: Click on the three horizontal lines in the top right corner, select \""Add-ons,\"" and then disable other extensions.\n\n2. **Clear Browser Cache**:\n   - A cluttered cache can sometimes cause extensions to behave inconsistently. You can clear your browser cache as follows:\n   - In Chrome: Go to the three-dot menu > \""More tools\"" > \""Clear browsing data.\"" Choose \""Cached images and files\"" and click \""Clear data.\""\n   - In Firefox: Click on the three horizontal lines > \""Options\"" > \""Privacy & Security\"" > scroll down to \""Cookies and Site Data\"" and click \""Clear Data.\""\n   - In Safari: Go to Safari > \""Preferences\"" > \""Privacy\"" > \""Manage Website Data\"" and click \""Remove All.\""\n   - In Edge: Click on the three-dot menu > \""Settings\"" > \""Privacy, search, and services\"" > \""Clear browsing data.\""\n\n3. **Update Your Browser**:\n   - Ensure your browser is up to date, as using an outdated version can cause compatibility issues.\n   - In Chrome: Go to the three-dot menu > \""Help\"" > \""About Google Chrome.\"" It will check for updates automatically.\n   - In Firefox: Click the three horizontal lines > \""Help\"" > \""About Firefox\"" to check for updates.\n   - In Safari: Make sure your operating system is up to date.\n   - In Edge: Go to the three-dot menu > \""Help and feedback\"" > \""About Microsoft Edge.\""\n\n4. **Reinstall Grammarly**:\n   - Uninstalling and reinstalling the Grammarly extension can sometimes resolve conflicts.\n   - In Chrome/Edge: Right-click on the Grammarly icon and select \""Remove.\"" Then visit the Chrome Web Store or Edge Add-ons site to reinstall.\n   - In Firefox: Click on \""Add-ons,\"" find Grammarly in your extensions, and select \""Remove.\"" Reinstall from the Firefox Add-ons site.\n\n5. **Test in Incognito/Private Mode**:\n   - Open an incognito window (Chrome/Edge) or a private window (Firefox) with only Grammarly enabled. This helps determine if the conflict is indeed due to other extensions.\n\n### If the Issue Persists:\n\nIf you’ve gone through all of these steps and are still experiencing problems, please let me know your browser version and operating system, and I can assist you further. It's also possible that there’s a specific conflict with another extension that we might need to address.\n\n### Additional Resources:\n\n- For more detailed guides and support, you can check our [Grammarly Help Center](https://support.grammarly.com).\n\nI'm here to help you every step of the way, so don't hesitate to reach out with any updates or further questions!""}]","","{""chat_completion"":{}}",11956,"{}","[]",\N
