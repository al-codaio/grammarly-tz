You can do this by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and hitting Enter.\n   - Locate the Grammarly extension and click the **Remove** button.\n   - Once removed, you can reinstall it by visiting the [Grammarly for Chrome page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/).\n   - Click on the **Add to Chrome** button and follow the prompts to add the extension back.\n\n2. **Clear Cache and Cookies**:\n   - After reinstalling, it might help to clear your browser's cache. To do this:\n     - Click the three dots in the top-right corner of Chrome.\n     - Go to **More Tools** > **Clear Browsing Data**.\n     - Select a time range (like \""All time\""), check the boxes for \""Cookies and other site data\"" and \""Cached images and files,\"" and click **Clear data**.\n\n3. **Update Chrome**:\n   - Ensure that you're using the most up-to-date version of Chrome:\n     - Click the three dots in the top-right corner.\n     - Go to **Help** > **About Google Chrome**.\n     - Chrome will check for updates automatically. If there’s an update available, it will download and install it.\n\n4. **Restart Your Computer**:\n   - Sometimes, a simple restart can solve many issues. Please restart your computer to ensure that everything is working properly.\n\n### Alternative Troubleshooting Steps\n\nIf the above steps don't resolve the issue, here are a couple of additional suggestions:\n\n- **Try a Different Profile**: Create a new user profile in Chrome and install Grammarly there. This will let you know if the issue is specific to your current profile.\n- **Check for Conflicting Extensions**: Sometimes, other extensions can interfere with Grammarly. Try disabling other extensions to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf you try all these steps and continue to face the same problem, please let me know, and I can escalate this issue to our human support team for further assistance. Also, it would be helpful to know your Chrome version and operating system, which can assist in diagnosing the problem.\n\nI hope this helps, and you’re back to enjoying Grammarly in no time!

Let’s clarify how you can integrate Grammarly into your Notion experience.\n\nGrammarly does not have a direct integration with Notion, but you can still utilize it in a couple of ways:\n\n### 1. **Using Grammarly's Browser Extension**\nIf you're using Notion on the web, the Grammarly browser extension should automatically check your writing in the Notion editor as long as it's enabled. Here’s how to ensure it's set up correctly:\n\n1. **Check Browser Compatibility**:\n   - Make sure you are using a supported browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). \n   \n2. **Verify the Extension is Enabled**:\n   - Look for the Grammarly icon in your browser's toolbar. If it’s grayed out, click on it to enable it for Notion.\n\n3. **Refresh Notion**:\n   - Sometimes, a simple refresh of the Notion page can activate Grammarly features. Press `F5` or click the refresh button in your browser.\n\n4. **Check Settings**:\n   - In the Grammarly extension settings, ensure that \""Enable for all sites\"" is checked.\n\n### 2. **Using Grammarly in a Separate Document**\nIf the above does not work for some reason, you can copy your text into a separate document, such as Google Docs or a Word document, where Grammarly provides full support. Here’s what to do:\n\n1. **Open Google Docs or Word**:\n   - Paste your text there and let Grammarly check it.\n\n2. **Make Corrections**:\n   - Go through Grammarly’s suggestions and make any necessary corrections.\n\n3. **Copy Back to Notion**:\n   - Once you’ve finished editing, copy the corrected text back into Notion.\n\n### Additional Suggestions\n- **Update Your Browser and Extension**: Ensure both your browser and the Grammarly extension are up to date.\n- **Restart Your Browser**: Sometimes, simply closing and reopening your browser can resolve minor issues.\n- **Clear Cache**: If you experience persistent issues, clearing your browser's cache can sometimes help.\n\nIf you still run into problems or if Grammarly isn't working as expected in Notion, feel free to reach out again. You may also consider checking Grammarly’s help center for more specific guides or updates regarding integrations.\n\nI hope this helps!

They can look into the issue with more detail. You can find support options directly on the [Grammarly Help Center](https://support.grammarly.com).\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure your operating system is also up to date, as this can impact browser performance.\n- If you’re regularly working with particularly large documents, consider editing in smaller sections.\n\nPlease let me know if you have questions about any of these steps or if there's anything else I can assist you with!""}]","{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"",""content"":""You are a helpful and knowledgeable Grammarly customer support specialist.

Let’s work together to resolve this issue.\n\n### Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the crashing issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Browser Version**: Ensure that your browser is updated to the latest version.\n   - For Chrome: Go to the menu (three dots in the upper right corner) > Help > About Google Chrome. This will automatically check for updates.\n   - For Firefox: Click the menu button (three lines) > Help > About Firefox.\n   - For Safari: Click \""Safari\"" in the top menu > About Safari.\n   - For Edge: Click the menu (three dots) > Help and feedback > About Microsoft Edge.\n\n2. **Clear your browser's cache**: Sometimes, cached data can cause issues.\n   - In Chrome: Go to Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data. Select \""Cached images and files\"" and click \""Clear data.\""\n   - In Firefox: Click the menu button, go to Options > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data, then click \""Clear Data.\""\n   - In Safari: Go to Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data, then remove the data.\n   - In Edge: Go to Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear browsing data.\n\n3. **Disable Other Extensions**: Other browser extensions can sometimes conflict with Grammarly. Try disabling them temporarily to see if this resolves the issue.\n   - In Chrome and Edge, go to the menu > More Tools > Extensions and toggle off other extensions.\n   - In Firefox, go to the menu > Add-ons and themes > Extensions, and disable any that are not essential.\n\n4. **Reinstall the Grammarly Extension**:\n   - Remove the Grammarly extension by going to your browser's extension settings.\n   - Reinstall it by visiting the Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or the respective store for your browser.\n\n5. **Try a Different Browser**: If you’re using Chrome, try switching to Firefox, Safari, or Edge to see if the issue persists there.\n\nIf you’ve tried all of the above steps and the issue continues, it might be best to reach out to our human support team for further assistance. They can look into the issue with more detail. You can find support options directly on the [Grammarly Help Center](https://support.grammarly.com).\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure your operating system is also up to date, as this can impact browser performance.\n- If you’re regularly working with particularly large documents, consider editing in smaller sections.\n\nPlease let me know if you have questions about any of these steps or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"",

I'm here to help you troubleshoot this issue.\n\nLet's work through some steps to get your app up and running again:\n\n### Step 1: Restart Your Mac\nSometimes, a simple restart can solve many issues. Click on the Apple icon in the top-left corner of your screen and select **Restart** from the dropdown menu.\n\n### Step 2: Check for Updates\nMake sure both your macOS and the Grammarly app are up to date:\n1. Click on the Apple icon and select **System Preferences**.\n2. Choose **Software Update** to check if there are any macOS updates available.\n3. If there’s an update, go ahead and install it.\n4. For the Grammarly app, open the **Mac App Store** and check if an update is available in the **Updates** tab.\n\n### Step 3: Clear Cache and Preferences\nClearing the cache and resetting preferences can resolve issues with the app:\n1. Close Grammarly if it’s open.\n2. Open Finder and click on **Go** in the top menu.\n3. Hold down the **Option** key and select **Library** from the dropdown.\n4. Navigate to **Caches** and find the Grammarly folder. Move it to the Trash.\n5. Go back to the **Library** folder, then to **Preferences**, and look for any files related to Grammarly. Move them to the Trash as well.\n6. Restart your Mac and try opening the app again.\n\n### Step 4: Reinstall Grammarly\nIf the app still won’t open, reinstalling it could help:\n1. Open **Finder** and go to the **Applications** folder.\n2. Find **Grammarly** and drag it to the Trash.\n3. Open the **Mac App Store**, search for Grammarly, and reinstall it.\n\n### Additional Troubleshooting\nIf none of these steps work, please check the following:\n- Ensure that you have sufficient disk space on your Mac.\n- Check if there are any security settings (like your firewall) restricting the app from opening.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and the app still won't open, I recommend reaching out to our human support team for further assistance. You can do this through the help section of the Grammarly website, where you can submit a request.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Try the above steps and see if the app opens.\n2. If you're still facing issues, please share your macOS version and the version of the Grammarly app you are trying to use. This will help us assist you better.\n\nI hope this helps to resolve your issue quickly!

This will download the document in a .docx format.\n\nIf you need to export multiple documents, you’ll need to repeat the above steps for each one.\n\n### Alternative Options:\n- If you’re looking to backup your work or keep a physical copy, you might consider copying the text from each document and pasting it into a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, then saving it from there.\n  \n### Next Steps:\nIf you have multiple documents and need further assistance with downloading each one or have other questions about Grammarly’s functions, feel free to ask! I’m here to help."",

I’m here to help you resolve this issue.\\n\\n### Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the sync problem:\\n\\n1. **Check for App Updates**:\\n   - Ensure that you have the latest version of the Grammarly app installed on your iOS device. You can check the App Store for updates.\\n\\n2. **Clear App Cache on iOS**:\\n   - Unfortunately, in iOS, you cannot clear the cache directly like in Android, but you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the app to refresh it.\\n\\n3. **Log Out of All Devices**:\\n   - Log out of the Grammarly app on your iPhone and also on browser extensions for Chrome and Edge. To log out:\\n     - Open the Grammarly app > Settings > Log Out.\\n   - After logging out, log back in on all devices (iOS app, Chrome, Edge).\\n\\n4. **Check for Multiple Accounts**:\\n   - Ensure that you are logging into the same Grammarly account across all platforms. Sometimes, multiple accounts can cause sync issues. \\n\\n5. **Check Internet Connection**:\\n   - Confirm that your iOS device has a stable internet connection. You might want to switch from Wi-Fi to cellular data or vice versa to see if there’s any difference.\\n\\n6. **Contact Support**:\\n   - If the issue persists, please reach out to Grammarly support directly through the help center or submit a ticket, especially since you have a specific error code (409). This information will help our support team assist you effectively.\\n\\n### Next Steps:\\n- Follow the above steps and check if the issue resolves. If not, please gather any error messages you're seeing and prepare to share them when contacting support.\\n- You can also visit our [Grammarly Help Center](https://support.grammarly.com/) for more resources and FAQs.\\n\\nI hope this helps, and I appreciate your patience as we work to get this resolved!\"",\""confidence\"":0.95,\""requires_human\"":true,\""suggested_actions\"":[\""Ask the customer if they have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app.\"",\""Encourage the customer to check their account for multiple logins or accounts.\"",\""Suggest contacting Grammarly support for further assistance.\""]}"",

Then, toggle the `Suggesting` mode off.\\n4. **Update Your Browser**: Ensure you have the latest version of your browser installed. \\n5. **Disable Browser Extensions**: Sometimes, other browser extensions can interfere. Disable them temporarily to see if it helps.\\n6. **Check for Grammarly Updates**: Ensure your Grammarly extension for Chrome is up to date. Go to the Chrome Web Store, find Grammarly, and check for updates.\\n7. **Reinstall Grammarly**: Remove the Grammarly extension from your browser and reinstall it from the Chrome Web Store. \\n8. **Test in Incognito Mode**: Open an Incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N) to see if the crash occurs there. This mode disables all extensions except for the ones you manually enable.\\n\\nIf you've tried all these steps and still experience crashes, the issue could be a bug or a compatibility problem with your configuration.\\n\\n### Next Steps:\\n- You can report this issue directly to Grammarly's support team for a deeper investigation.

I completely understand how frustrating it can be when things don't work as expected, especially when they were fine just yesterday. Let's work together to identify the issue and find a solution.\n\nHere’s what I can help you with:\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps for Extension Conflicts:\n\n1. **Restart Your Browser**:\n   - Close all tabs and completely shut down your browser.\n   - Restart the browser and check if Grammarly works.\n\n2. **Check for Extension Conflicts**:\n   - Disable other extensions temporarily to see if they are causing the conflict with Grammarly. You can do this by:\n     - For **Chrome**:\n        - Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.\n        - Navigate to “More tools” > “Extensions.”\n        - Toggle off other extensions one by one or use the \""Remove\"" option for each.\n     - For **Firefox**:\n        - Click on the three horizontal lines in the upper right corner.\n        - Select “Add-ons” > “Extensions.”\n        - Disable them similarly as mentioned for Chrome.\n     - For **Safari**:\n        - Go to \""Preferences\"" > “Extensions.”\n        - Uncheck the boxes of other extensions to disable them.\n     - For **Edge**:\n        - Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.\n        - Go to “Extensions” and disable or remove any that could be conflicting.\n\n3. **Clear Your Browser Cache**:\n   - Sometimes, clearing your cache can resolve issues with extensions. Here’s how:\n     - For **Chrome**: \n       - Go to “Settings” > “Privacy and security” > “Clear browsing data.” \n     - For **Firefox**: \n       - Go to “Options” > “Privacy & Security” > “Cookies and Site Data” and click “Clear Data.” \n     - For **Safari**:\n       - Go to the “History” menu and select “Clear History.”\n     - For **Edge**: \n       - Go to “Settings” > “Privacy, search, and services” > “Clear browsing data.”\n\n4. **Reinstall Grammarly**:\n   - If the issue persists, try removing and then reinstalling the Grammarly extension:\n     - Follow the instruction for your browser to remove the extension.\n     - Visit the [Grammarly website](https://www.grammarly.com) to reinstall the extension.\n\n5. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Ensure both your browser and the Grammarly extension are up to date.

        ""content"": ""I’m sorry to hear that you’re experiencing conflicts with the Grammarly browser extension. I completely understand how frustrating it can be when things don't work as expected, especially when they were fine just yesterday. Let's work together to identify the issue and find a solution.\n\nHere’s what I can help you with:\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps for Extension Conflicts:\n\n1. **Restart Your Browser**:\n   - Close all tabs and completely shut down your browser.\n   - Restart the browser and check if Grammarly works.\n\n2. **Check for Extension Conflicts**:\n   - Disable other extensions temporarily to see if they are causing the conflict with Grammarly. You can do this by:\n     - For **Chrome**:\n        - Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.\n        - Navigate to “More tools” > “Extensions.”\n        - Toggle off other extensions one by one or use the \""Remove\"" option for each.\n     - For **Firefox**:\n        - Click on the three horizontal lines in the upper right corner.\n        - Select “Add-ons” > “Extensions.”\n        - Disable them similarly as mentioned for Chrome.\n     - For **Safari**:\n        - Go to \""Preferences\"" > “Extensions.”\n        - Uncheck the boxes of other extensions to disable them.\n     - For **Edge**:\n        - Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.\n        - Go to “Extensions” and disable or remove any that could be conflicting.\n\n3. **Clear Your Browser Cache**:\n   - Sometimes, clearing your cache can resolve issues with extensions. Here’s how:\n     - For **Chrome**: \n       - Go to “Settings” > “Privacy and security” > “Clear browsing data.” \n     - For **Firefox**: \n       - Go to “Options” > “Privacy & Security” > “Cookies and Site Data” and click “Clear Data.” \n     - For **Safari**:\n       - Go to the “History” menu and select “Clear History.”\n     - For **Edge**: \n       - Go to “Settings” > “Privacy, search, and services” > “Clear browsing data.”\n\n4. **Reinstall Grammarly**:\n   - If the issue persists, try removing and then reinstalling the Grammarly extension:\n     - Follow the instruction for your browser to remove the extension.\n     - Visit the [Grammarly website](https://www.grammarly.com) to reinstall the extension.\n\n5. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Ensure both your browser and the Grammarly extension are up to date. You can check for updates in the respective browser settings.\n\n### Next Steps If Issues Persist:\nIf Grammarly still isn’t functioning correctly after following these steps, it may be helpful to reach out to our support team with more details about the extensions you have installed and the specific issues you’re facing. This way, we can provide more tailored assistance.\n\nYou can also try using Grammarly in **Does Not Work Without the Extension** mode by using the web app at [grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com) as a temporary workaround.\n\nLet me know how it goes, or if you have any further questions or need more help!"",

If it's off, toggle it back on.\n\n2. **Update Chrome**:\n   - Click on the three vertical dots in Chrome, go to **Help** > **About Google Chrome**.\n   - If there's an update available, Chrome will download it automatically. Once it’s done, relaunch Chrome.\n\n3. **Clear Browser Cache**:\n   - Click on the three dots in the upper right corner and go to **More Tools** > **Clear Browsing Data**.\n   - Select **Cookies and other site data** and **Cached images and files**, then click **Clear data**.\n\n4. **Restart Your Device**:\n   - Sometimes a simple restart can help clear up issues with extensions. After restarting, open Chrome and go to Google Docs again.\n\n5. **Try Incognito Mode**:\n   - Open an Incognito window (Ctrl + Shift + N) and log in to Google Docs there. The Grammarly extension should work in Incognito if it’s enabled for that mode (you can enable it in the Extensions menu).\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and the extension is still not appearing, it might be helpful to uninstall and reinstall the Grammarly extension:\n\n6. **Reinstall Grammarly Extension**:\n   - Go back to the Extensions menu in Chrome, find Grammarly, and click on **Remove**.\n   - Revisit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) to reinstall Grammarly.\n\n### Next Steps:\nIf the problem persists after following these steps, please let me know your Chrome version and the operating system you're using, and we can look into it further.

Let's work together to resolve the issue you’re facing, which may be caused by conflicts with other browser extensions.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this situation:\n\n### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting\n\n1. **Disable Other Extensions**:\n   - **Google Chrome**: \n     - Click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner.\n     - Go to **More Tools** > **Extensions**.\n     - Disable all extensions except Grammarly by toggling them off.\n   - **Firefox**:\n     - Click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner.\n     - Go to **Add-ons** > **Extensions**.\n     - Disable other extensions.\n   - **Safari**:\n     - Go to **Safari** in the menu bar and select **Preferences**.\n     - Click on the **Extensions** tab and disable other extensions.\n   - **Edge**:\n     - Click on the three horizontal dots in the top-right corner.\n     - Go to **Extensions**.\n     - Disable all other extensions.\n\n2. **Check if Grammarly Works**:\n   - After disabling other extensions, check if Grammarly starts functioning again. If it does, you can enable each extension one by one to identify which one is causing the conflict.\n\n3. **Clear Cache and Cookies**:\n   - Sometimes, cached data can create issues. Here’s how to clear your cache and cookies:\n     - For Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, you can usually find this option in **Settings** > **Privacy and Security** > **Clear browsing data**.\n     - For Safari, go to **Preferences** > **Privacy** > **Manage Website Data** and then remove data.\n\n4. **Restart Your Browser**:\n   - Close your browser completely and reopen it to ensure changes take effect.\n\n5. **Update Your Browser**:\n   - Make sure your browser is up-to-date. Check for updates in the browser settings.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can try reinstalling the Grammarly extension:\n  - Uninstall the extension from your browser’s extension settings.\n  - Reinstall it from the [Grammarly website](https://www.grammarly.com).\n\nIf you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, please let me know your browser version and operating system. I could then assist you further or refer your case for more specialized support.\n\n### Next Steps\nKeep me updated on your progress after attempting these troubleshooting steps.

        ""content"": ""I understand how frustrating it can be when your Grammarly extension suddenly stops working, especially after it was functioning perfectly just yesterday. Let's work together to resolve the issue you’re facing, which may be caused by conflicts with other browser extensions.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this situation:\n\n### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting\n\n1. **Disable Other Extensions**:\n   - **Google Chrome**: \n     - Click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner.\n     - Go to **More Tools** > **Extensions**.\n     - Disable all extensions except Grammarly by toggling them off.\n   - **Firefox**:\n     - Click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner.\n     - Go to **Add-ons** > **Extensions**.\n     - Disable other extensions.\n   - **Safari**:\n     - Go to **Safari** in the menu bar and select **Preferences**.\n     - Click on the **Extensions** tab and disable other extensions.\n   - **Edge**:\n     - Click on the three horizontal dots in the top-right corner.\n     - Go to **Extensions**.\n     - Disable all other extensions.\n\n2. **Check if Grammarly Works**:\n   - After disabling other extensions, check if Grammarly starts functioning again. If it does, you can enable each extension one by one to identify which one is causing the conflict.\n\n3. **Clear Cache and Cookies**:\n   - Sometimes, cached data can create issues. Here’s how to clear your cache and cookies:\n     - For Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, you can usually find this option in **Settings** > **Privacy and Security** > **Clear browsing data**.\n     - For Safari, go to **Preferences** > **Privacy** > **Manage Website Data** and then remove data.\n\n4. **Restart Your Browser**:\n   - Close your browser completely and reopen it to ensure changes take effect.\n\n5. **Update Your Browser**:\n   - Make sure your browser is up-to-date. Check for updates in the browser settings.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can try reinstalling the Grammarly extension:\n  - Uninstall the extension from your browser’s extension settings.\n  - Reinstall it from the [Grammarly website](https://www.grammarly.com).\n\nIf you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, please let me know your browser version and operating system. I could then assist you further or refer your case for more specialized support.\n\n### Next Steps\nKeep me updated on your progress after attempting these troubleshooting steps. If you find conflicts with specific extensions, I can provide more information about compatibility or further options. Thank you for your patience, and I’m here to help!"",

I understand how convenient it would be to have both features integrated seamlessly.\n\nCurrently, Grammarly does not support built-in voice typing. However, you can use a separate voice typing tool in conjunction with Grammarly for grammar checking. Here’s how you can do that:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Use Google Docs Voice Typing** (if you have a Google account):\n   - Open Google Docs in your web browser.\n   - Click on **\""Tools\""** in the menu bar.\n   - Select **\""Voice typing...\""**. A microphone icon will appear.\n   - Click the microphone icon to start voice typing.\n   - Once you've finished, copy your text.\n\n2. **Paste into Grammarly**:\n   - Open your Grammarly editor (either in your browser or the desktop app).\n   - Paste the text you copied from Google Docs into Grammarly to check for grammar and style suggestions.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\n- **Voice Typing Apps**: You can also explore third-party voice-to-text applications such as **Dragon NaturallySpeaking** or **Otter.ai**.

I understand how convenient it would be to have both features integrated seamlessly.\n\nCurrently, Grammarly does not support built-in voice typing. However, you can use a separate voice typing tool in conjunction with Grammarly for grammar checking. Here’s how you can do that:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Use Google Docs Voice Typing** (if you have a Google account):\n   - Open Google Docs in your web browser.\n   - Click on **\""Tools\""** in the menu bar.\n   - Select **\""Voice typing...\""**. A microphone icon will appear.\n   - Click the microphone icon to start voice typing.\n   - Once you've finished, copy your text.\n\n2. **Paste into Grammarly**:\n   - Open your Grammarly editor (either in your browser or the desktop app).\n   - Paste the text you copied from Google Docs into Grammarly to check for grammar and style suggestions.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\n- **Voice Typing Apps**: You can also explore third-party voice-to-text applications such as **Dragon NaturallySpeaking** or **Otter.ai**. These can transcribe your speech into text, which you can then paste into Grammarly for grammar checking.\n\n### What's Next:\nWhile it's not the ideal integrated solution you were hoping for, I encourage you to try combining these tools for a smoother workflow.

I understand how important it is for your work to be accurately represented. While Grammarly Premium doesn’t currently have a feature to train the system to recognize industry-specific terminology directly, there are a couple of ways you can manage this:\\n\\n1. **Personal Dictionary**: You can add technical terms, acronyms, and industry-specific words to your personal dictionary. This way, Grammarly will no longer flag them as incorrect. Here's how you can do this:\\n   - Log into your Grammarly account.\\n   - Click on your name in the bottom-left corner and select 'Profile'.\\n   - Navigate to 'Personal Dictionary'.\\n   - Add your specific terms and acronyms here.\\n\\n2. **Feedback Feature**: If Grammarly still flags words incorrectly, use the feedback feature to let our team know. Over time, this can help improve Grammarly's understanding of such terms.\\n\\n3. **Custom Style Guides**: For team or business accounts, you can create a custom style guide that might offer an alternative way to ensure consistent language use across your documents.\\n\\nIf you have specific examples, sharing them via our feedback feature helps us refine our algorithms to better suit technical writing needs. If you need further assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out!\\n\\nI hope this information helps you have a smoother experience with Grammarly.

Enabling Grammarly in Word is generally straightforward, and I'll walk you through the steps.\n\n### How to Enable Grammarly in Microsoft Word:\n\n1. **Check Your Installation:**\n   - Ensure you have installed the Grammarly for Microsoft Office add-in. If you haven't done so, you can download it from the [Grammarly website](https://www.grammarly.com/office-addin).\n\n2. **Open Microsoft Word:**\n   - Launch Microsoft Word on your computer.\n\n3. **Enable Add-in:**\n   - **For Windows:**\n     - Go to the \""Insert\"" tab in the Word ribbon.\n     - Look for the \""My Add-ins\"" or \""Get Add-ins\"" option.\n     - Find Grammarly in the list and click on it to add it.\n   - **For Mac:**\n     - Go to the \""Insert\"" menu.\n     - Select \""My Add-ins.\""\n     - Choose Grammarly from the available options.\n\n4. **Log into Grammarly:**\n   - Once the add-in is enabled, a sidebar will appear on the right side of your Word document.\n   - You’ll need to log in with your Grammarly account. If you don’t already have an account, you can create one.\n\n5. **Start Writing:**\n   - After logging in, you can start typing your document, and Grammarly will provide suggestions directly in the sidebar!\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n- **If You Don’t See Grammarly:**\n  - Make sure that your version of Microsoft Word is up to date.

Try opening a web page or another app to confirm this.\n   \n2. **Sign Out and Back In**:\n   - Sometimes, simply signing out of your Grammarly account and then signing back in can resolve syncing issues.\n   - On the app or website, go to your account settings and select “Sign Out.” Once signed out, sign back in.\n\n3. **Update Your App**:\n   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Grammarly app on your devices. \n     - For **iOS** and **Android**: Check the App Store or Google Play Store for updates.\n     - For **Windows** and **Mac**: Grammarly should prompt for updates, but you can also check for updates in the app settings.\n\n4. **Clear Cache and Data** (if you're using the app):\n   - For **iOS**: Go to Settings > General > [App Name] and select “Delete App.” Then, reinstall it from the App Store.\n   - For **Android**: Go to Settings > Apps > Grammarly > Storage > Clear Cache and Clear Data. Restart the app afterward.\n   - For **Windows**: In the app, go to Settings and look for options to clear the app data or cache.\n\n5. **Try Another Device or Browser**:\n   - If possible, try accessing your account from another device or browser to see if the documents show up there. This helps to identify if the problem is device-specific.\n\n6. **Check Your Account**:\n   - Make sure you’re signed into the same Grammarly account on all devices. Sometimes, syncing issues arise from using different accounts.\n\n### If the Problem Persists:\nIf you've tried all these steps and are still facing syncing issues, please let me know the following:\n\n- The browser and version you are using (if applicable).\n- The operating system of the devices you're using (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android).\n  \nThis information will help us further diagnose the problem, and I may need to escalate the issue to our technical team for specific assistance.\n\n### Next Steps:\nPlease attempt the above steps, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any additional questions or updates.

Restart Chrome after the update.\n\n### 6. **Test in Incognito Mode**\n   - To check if other extensions are causing issues, open an Incognito window (Ctrl + Shift + N).\n   - Go to the Grammarly website and see if it loads normally there (remember, extensions are disabled in Incognito by default).\n\nIf none of these steps work, please let me know your operating system and the version of Chrome you're using, and we can look into further options together.

While Grammarly currently does not have direct support for Markdown file formats, I'm here to provide you with some helpful insights on how you can still use Grammarly effectively with your Markdown content.\n\n### Current Workaround for Using Grammarly with Markdown:\n\n1. **Copy and Paste**: One simple way to use Grammarly with Markdown is to copy the text from your Markdown file and paste it into the Grammarly editor on the web or in the desktop app. After making your edits, you can then copy the revised text back into your Markdown file.\n\n2. **Use a Text Editor with Grammarly Integration**: Another option is to use a text editor that has built-in support for Grammarly. For example, some editors like Visual Studio Code have Grammarly extensions that can help you check your Markdown content.\n\n3. **Browser Extension**: If you're writing Markdown in an online platform (like a CMS or collaborative editor), make sure to have the Grammarly browser extension enabled.

While Grammarly currently does not have direct support for Markdown file formats, I'm here to provide you with some helpful insights on how you can still use Grammarly effectively with your Markdown content.\n\n### Current Workaround for Using Grammarly with Markdown:\n\n1. **Copy and Paste**: One simple way to use Grammarly with Markdown is to copy the text from your Markdown file and paste it into the Grammarly editor on the web or in the desktop app. After making your edits, you can then copy the revised text back into your Markdown file.\n\n2. **Use a Text Editor with Grammarly Integration**: Another option is to use a text editor that has built-in support for Grammarly. For example, some editors like Visual Studio Code have Grammarly extensions that can help you check your Markdown content.\n\n3. **Browser Extension**: If you're writing Markdown in an online platform (like a CMS or collaborative editor), make sure to have the Grammarly browser extension enabled. This will help you catch grammar and spelling errors as you write.\n\n### Suggestions for Feature Request:\n\nIf you’d like to officially request Markdown support, you can visit the Grammarly feedback page.

I'm here to help you get this sorted out.\n\nSince you're using the Grammarly Business plan along with the Microsoft Office plugin on a Windows platform, let's go through some steps to troubleshoot this issue.\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot Grammarly in PowerPoint:\n\n1. **Check Plugin Installation**:\n   - Ensure that the Grammarly add-in is properly installed in PowerPoint. To do this:\n     - Open PowerPoint.\n     - Click on the **Insert** tab.\n     - Select **Get Add-ins**.\n     - In the add-ins window, search for \""Grammarly.\"" If it's not installed, download and install it from there.\n\n2. **Enable Grammarly Add-in**:\n   - Sometimes, the add-in may be disabled. To check:\n     - In PowerPoint, go to the **File** menu.\n     - Click on **Options**, then select **Add-ins**.\n     - At the bottom, ensure that **Manage: COM Add-ins** is selected and click **Go**.\n     - Make sure the checkbox next to Grammarly is checked. If it's unchecked, check it and click **OK**.\n\n3. **Update Microsoft Office**:\n   - An outdated version of Microsoft Office may cause compatibility issues. To update:\n     - Open any Office application (like Word or Excel).\n     - Go to the **File** menu, select **Account**, and click on **Update Options** > **Update Now**.\n\n4. **Restart PowerPoint and Your Computer**:\n   - Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve issues.

I'm here to help you get this sorted out.\n\nSince you're using the Grammarly Business plan along with the Microsoft Office plugin on a Windows platform, let's go through some steps to troubleshoot this issue.\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot Grammarly in PowerPoint:\n\n1. **Check Plugin Installation**:\n   - Ensure that the Grammarly add-in is properly installed in PowerPoint. To do this:\n     - Open PowerPoint.\n     - Click on the **Insert** tab.\n     - Select **Get Add-ins**.\n     - In the add-ins window, search for \""Grammarly.\"" If it's not installed, download and install it from there.\n\n2. **Enable Grammarly Add-in**:\n   - Sometimes, the add-in may be disabled. To check:\n     - In PowerPoint, go to the **File** menu.\n     - Click on **Options**, then select **Add-ins**.\n     - At the bottom, ensure that **Manage: COM Add-ins** is selected and click **Go**.\n     - Make sure the checkbox next to Grammarly is checked. If it's unchecked, check it and click **OK**.\n\n3. **Update Microsoft Office**:\n   - An outdated version of Microsoft Office may cause compatibility issues. To update:\n     - Open any Office application (like Word or Excel).\n     - Go to the **File** menu, select **Account**, and click on **Update Options** > **Update Now**.\n\n4. **Restart PowerPoint and Your Computer**:\n   - Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve issues. Close PowerPoint completely and restart your computer to ensure that changes take effect.\n\n5. **Clear Cache** (if issues persist):\n   - Clearing cache can be helpful:\n     - Close all Office applications.\n     - Open the Run dialog by pressing `Windows + R`.\n     - Type `%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Office\\` and press **Enter**.\n     - Look for the **Office** folder and delete any temporary files if present.\n\n6. **Reinstall Grammarly Add-in**:\n   - If Grammarly still isn't working, consider removing and reinstalling the add-in:\n     - Go to **Insert** > **Get Add-ins**, find Grammarly, and choose to remove it.\n     - Follow step 1 to reinstall it from the add-ins store.\n\n### After Trying These Steps:\nOnce you've completed these steps, please check if Grammarly is now detecting errors in your PowerPoint presentations.

You can check the list of participating institutions on our website.\n\n2. **Verify Your Account:**\n   - Ensure that you are logged into the Grammarly account associated with your student email address. Discounts are typically tied to that specific email domain (e.g., .edu).\n\n3. **Check Discount Code:**\n   - If you were given a discount code, ensure you entered it correctly at checkout. Any small error could prevent the discount from applying.\n\n4. **Refresh Your Account:**\n   - Sometimes, a quick refresh can help. Log out of your account, clear your browser's cache, and log back in.\n\n5. **Using the Right Link:**\n   - Make sure you are using the specific student discount link provided by your institution or from Grammarly. Using the regular signup link won’t apply the discount.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and the discount still isn’t applying, please let me know your browser and operating system, as well as if you’re experiencing any error messages.

Go to the **Insert** tab in Microsoft Word.\n     2. Click on **Get Add-ins** or **Office Add-ins**.\n     3. In the search bar, type “Grammarly” and press Enter.\n     4.

To check this:\n  - Go to **File** > **Options** > **Add-ins**.\n  - Look for Grammarly in the list of inactive add-ins. If it’s there, select it and click **Enable**.\n\n### Next Steps:\nAfter following these steps, you should see Grammarly working in Microsoft Word.

I understand how important it is to have seamless accessibility support, and I’m here to help you.\\n\\nHere’s how you can improve NVDA’s interaction with Grammarly’s suggestion cards:\\n\\n1. **Ensure NVDA is Updated**: First, make sure you have the latest version of NVDA. You can check for updates within NVDA by navigating to 'Help' > 'Check for Updates'.\\n\\n2. **Check Browser and OS Compatibility**: Make sure your web browser and operating system are updated, as sometimes compatibility issues can affect NVDA’s functionality.\\n\\n3. **Adjust NVDA’s Settings**:\\n   - Open NVDA and go to the 'NVDA Menu'.\\n   - Select 'Preferences' > 'Settings' > 'Speech' and ensure the speech verbosity level is set to a level that allows reading of all content.\\n   - Navigate to 'Browse Mode' and ensure it is appropriately configured. Ensure that ‘Automatic Focus Mode Switching’ is enabled, which can help NVDA switch modes as needed.\\n\\n4. **Enable Accessibility Settings in Grammarly**:\\n   - Open the Grammarly settings in your browser or desktop app.\\n   - Ensure that any accessibility features are enabled. Although Grammarly doesn’t have extensive accessibility settings, ensuring these are all set correctly can sometimes help.\\n\\nIf you're still encountering issues after these steps, it might be helpful to try using a different web browser, as interaction can vary slightly between them.\\n\\nIf you need further assistance, please let me know, and I can escalate this to our technical team for a deeper dive into the issue. Your experience is important to us, and we're committed to improving it.\\n\\nLet me know if there’s anything else I can assist you with!\"",\""confidence\"":0.95,\""requires_human\"":false,\""suggested_actions\"":[\""Verify that NVDA is updated to the latest version\"",\""Check for updates or patches specific to Windows 11\"",\""Try enabling Grammarly accessibility settings if available\"",\""Suggest trying different browsers if issues persist\""]}"",

I’m here to help you get Grammarly running smoothly so that those errors can be fixed easily!\n\nGrammarly integrates directly with Google Docs, and here’s how you can use it to fix grammar errors:\n\n### Steps to Fix Grammar Errors in Google Docs with Grammarly:\n\n1. **Enable Grammarly in Google Docs:**\n   - Open your Google Docs document.\n   - Ensure you have the Grammarly Chrome extension installed and that you’re logged into your Grammarly account.\n   - Once the extension is active, Grammarly will automatically check your text for grammar errors.\n\n2. **Check for Errors:**\n   - As you type, you should see underlined words or phrases. \n   - Red underlines typically indicate grammar errors, while blue underlines indicate style suggestions.\n\n3. **Review Suggestions:**\n   - Click on the underlined word or phrase, and a suggestion box will appear.\n   - Click on the proposed correction to apply it instantly, or you can dismiss the suggestion if you prefer to keep your original text.\n\n4. **Adjust Settings (if needed):**\n   - If you find Grammarly isn't highlighting errors, make sure that its settings are configured properly.\n   - Click on the Grammarly icon in the Chrome toolbar, then go to \""Account\"" > \""Settings,\"" and check that \""Grammar\"" is enabled.\n\n5. **Refresh the Page:**\n   - If Grammarly isn’t working, try refreshing the Google Docs page or restarting your browser. This can resolve minor glitches.\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n- **Check Your Browser:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Chrome. You can update it via the Chrome menu (`Help` > `About Google Chrome`).\n- **Clear Cache:** Sometimes clearing your browser's cache can help with extensions. You can do this by going to Chrome settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data.\n- **Reinstall the Extension:** If issues persist, remove and then reinstall the Grammarly extension from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nIf you’re still having trouble or if Grammarly isn’t working as expected, please let me know your browser version and operating system. I’d be glad to provide further assistance!\n\n### Additional Resources:\n- [Grammarly Help Center](https://support.grammarly.com/)\n- [Google Docs Support](https://support.google.com/docs)\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance!""}]","{""messages"":[{""role"":""system"",""content"":""You are a helpful and knowledgeable Grammarly customer support specialist.

I'm here to help you troubleshoot this issue.\n\nTo start, let's ensure that everything is set up correctly with your Grammarly integration in PowerPoint. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. **Check Version**: Make sure you have the latest version of both Microsoft PowerPoint and the Grammarly add-in. You can update PowerPoint through the Microsoft 365 updates or by checking the built-in updater.\n\n2. **Enable Grammarly Add-in**:\n   - Open PowerPoint and go to the “Insert” tab.\n   - Click on “My Add-ins” then “Grammarly” to ensure it’s enabled.\n\n3. **Error Detection Settings**:\n   - After enabling the add-in, check if the Grammarly sidebar appears on the right side of your PowerPoint.\n   - Make sure you are logged into your Grammarly account in the sidebar.\n\n4. **Restart the Application**: Sometimes simply restarting PowerPoint can help. Save your work and close PowerPoint, then reopen it to see if the issue resolves.\n\n5. **Clear Cache**: If the problem persists, try clearing the cache of the Grammarly add-in by following these steps:\n   - Close PowerPoint completely.\n   - Navigate to the following directory: `C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word` (you may need to replace Word with PowerPoint).\n   - Look for any Grammarly related files and delete them.\n\n6. **Reinstall the Add-in**: If it still doesn't work, consider uninstalling and then reinstalling the Grammarly add-in:\n   - Go to “Insert” > “My Add-ins.”\n   - Find Grammarly and uninstall it.\n   - Go back to “My Add-ins” and re-add Grammarly from the store.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and Grammarly is still not detecting errors, it may be best to reach out to our technical support team for further assistance. You can do this by visiting our support page at [Grammarly Support](https://support.grammarly.com).\n\nIn the meantime, if you're experiencing specific types of text that aren't being checked, please let me know, and I can provide additional insights on whether certain elements might be recognized differently by Grammarly.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance.

I'm here to help you with that.\n\nUnfortunately, subscriptions are tied to the original email address used for sign-up, and there isn't a direct way to transfer a subscription to another email. However, I can guide you through the options available:\n\n### Option 1: Change the Email Address on Your Account\nIf you just want to update the email address associated with your account, you can do this easily:\n\n1. **Log in** to your Grammarly account at [www.grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com).\n2. Click on your **profile icon** in the bottom left corner.\n3. Select **Account**.\n4. Under the **Email address** section, click **Edit**.\n5. Enter your new email address and follow the prompts to confirm the change.\n\n### Option 2: Create a New Account\nIf you want to start fresh with a new subscription under a completely different email, you would need to:\n1. Sign up for a new Grammarly account using your desired email address.\n2. If you want, you can cancel your existing subscription—just let me know if you'd like help with this process.\n\n### Refund Policy\nKeep in mind that if you're looking to cancel your original subscription for a refund, we can provide refunds under our policy. Please let me know if that’s the case, and I can guide you through that.\n\n### Next Steps\nIf you encounter any issues while following these steps or if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out again.

Updates often include improvements for better compatibility. You can download the latest version from the NVDA website.\\n\\n2. **Update Grammarly**: Ensure that you have the latest version of the Grammarly desktop app installed as well. Updates can help resolve bugs and improve features.

This sometimes helps in ensuring the content is read correctly.\\n\\n4. **Check NVDA Settings**: Go to NVDA's settings and ensure that the verbosity or speech settings are optimized for reading web content.

        ""content"": ""I understand your frustration with Grammarly not working as expected, and I’m here to help you clarify its compatibility with LibreOffice.\n\nCurrently, Grammarly does not offer an official integration with LibreOffice. However, you can still use Grammarly for your writing in a different way. Here’s how you can make it work for you:\n\n1. **Use the Grammarly Web Editor**:\n   - Go to the [Grammarly website](https://app.grammarly.com).\n   - Log in to your account.\n   - Copy and paste your text from LibreOffice into the Grammarly web editor to check for grammar and spelling issues.\n\n2. **Copy Text Back to LibreOffice**:\n   - Once you’ve made corrections and adjustments in the Grammarly editor, copy the revised text.\n   - Paste it back into your LibreOffice document.\n\n3. **Browser Extension**:\n   - If you’re using LibreOffice in a web browser (like Google Docs), the Grammarly browser extension will work there. Ensure you have the extension installed and enabled.\n\nIf Grammarly was working for you previously but has stopped, it might just be a temporary issue. Here are some basic troubleshooting steps you can try:\n\n1. **Restart your Computer**: Sometimes a simple restart can resolve unexpected issues.\n2. **Clear Browser Cache** (if you're using the web):\n   - In your browser settings, find the option to clear browsing data and proceed to clear cached files.\n3. **Check for Updates**: Ensure your browser is up-to-date as compatibility can depend on that.\n4. **Reinstall Grammarly Extension**: Remove the Grammarly extension from your browser and reinstall it from the official extension store.\n\nIf you try these steps and continue to experience issues, please let me know the browser you’re using, as well as any error messages you’re seeing. I’ll be glad to assist you further!"",

I understand how frustrating it can be when the app isn't working as expected. Let’s work together to resolve this problem.\n\n### Here's what we'll do:\n\n1. **Check for Updates**: Make sure both the Grammarly app and your iOS device are updated to the latest versions. This can often resolve crashing issues.\n   - Go to the App Store on your iPhone or iPad, tap on your profile icon in the top right, and scroll down to see if there's an update available for Grammarly. \n   - For your iOS device, go to **Settings > General > Software Update** to check for any available system updates.\n\n2. **Restart the App**: Sometimes, simply restarting the app can help.\n   - Close the Grammarly keyboard by swiping up from the bottom of the screen (or double-clicking the Home button for older devices) and swiping the Grammarly app off the screen. Open it again and see if it works properly.\n\n3. **Re-enable the Keyboard**: Toggle the Grammarly keyboard off and then back on.\n   - Go to **Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards**. Find the Grammarly keyboard and remove it, then re-add it.\n\n4. **Clear Cache**: If clearing the app’s cache is an option on iOS, it could alleviate some issues. Unfortunately, iOS has limited options here, but you can try reinstalling the app.\n   - Uninstall the Grammarly app by holding down on the app icon until it shakes, then tap the 'X' or 'Remove App.'\n   - Reinstall Grammarly from the App Store.\n\n5. **Contact Support**: If the keyboard continues to crash after trying the above steps, please reach out directly to Grammarly support through the app or their website for personalized assistance. They can look deeper into the issue.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Make sure there are no other keyboard apps interfering with the Grammarly keyboard functionality.\n- Restart your device to refresh all system processes.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have any more questions, please let me know.

        ""content"": ""I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with the Grammarly keyboard on iOS. I understand how frustrating it can be when the app isn't working as expected. Let’s work together to resolve this problem.\n\n### Here's what we'll do:\n\n1. **Check for Updates**: Make sure both the Grammarly app and your iOS device are updated to the latest versions. This can often resolve crashing issues.\n   - Go to the App Store on your iPhone or iPad, tap on your profile icon in the top right, and scroll down to see if there's an update available for Grammarly. \n   - For your iOS device, go to **Settings > General > Software Update** to check for any available system updates.\n\n2. **Restart the App**: Sometimes, simply restarting the app can help.\n   - Close the Grammarly keyboard by swiping up from the bottom of the screen (or double-clicking the Home button for older devices) and swiping the Grammarly app off the screen. Open it again and see if it works properly.\n\n3. **Re-enable the Keyboard**: Toggle the Grammarly keyboard off and then back on.\n   - Go to **Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards**. Find the Grammarly keyboard and remove it, then re-add it.\n\n4. **Clear Cache**: If clearing the app’s cache is an option on iOS, it could alleviate some issues. Unfortunately, iOS has limited options here, but you can try reinstalling the app.\n   - Uninstall the Grammarly app by holding down on the app icon until it shakes, then tap the 'X' or 'Remove App.'\n   - Reinstall Grammarly from the App Store.\n\n5. **Contact Support**: If the keyboard continues to crash after trying the above steps, please reach out directly to Grammarly support through the app or their website for personalized assistance. They can look deeper into the issue.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Make sure there are no other keyboard apps interfering with the Grammarly keyboard functionality.\n- Restart your device to refresh all system processes.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have any more questions, please let me know. We want to ensure you can use Grammarly smoothly on your iOS device!"",
