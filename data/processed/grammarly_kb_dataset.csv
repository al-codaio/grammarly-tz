Sometimes, this issue can be solved by simply restarting your computer. Make sure that you do so before proceeding to the steps below.
The error message “Something went wrong” or a gray Grammarly widget is usually caused by restrictions within your network, VPN, proxy, or firewall settings.
To resolve this, you need to ensure that your network, firewall, VPN, or proxy allows access to the following internet addresses:
*.grammarly.com (ports 80 and 443)
*.grammarly.io (ports 80 and 443)
*.grammarly.net (ports 80 and 443)
You or your IT administrator may need to add exception rules for the above addresses to your network, firewall, VPN, or proxy settings.
Additionally, Grammarly apps use WebSockets to communicate with our servers, with the corresponding ports of 80 and 443. Besides allowing the URLs mentioned above, you need to ensure that your network, VPN, firewall, or proxy fully supports the WebSocket protocol. You can read more about WebSocket support in this article:
WebSockets Support Q&A for System Administrators

app configured in Microsoft Entra ID
SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) enabled in Grammarly
Step-by-Step Configuration Instructions
Log in to your Grammarly account, go to the
Provisioning
page, and click
Configure
.
Click the
Activate SCIM
button.
Generate a SCIM token by clicking the
Create token
link.
Copy the SCIM token for future use, click

, and close the window.
Sign in to the
Microsoft Azure portal
. Select
Enterprise applications
, then select
All applications
.
In the applications list, select
Grammarly.
Select the
Provisioning
tab.
Set the
Provisioning Mode
to
Automatic
.
Under the
Admin Credentials
section, in the enter
Tenant URL
field enter
https://sso.grammarly.com/scim/v2
, and in the
Secret Token
field enter the token provided by Grammarly (see
Step 4
above). Click
Test Connection
to ensure Microsoft Entra ID can connect to Grammarly. If the connection fails, ensure your Grammarly account has Admin permissions and try again.
Click
Save
.
In the
Notification Email
field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the box next to
Send an email notification when a failure occurs check
.
Under the
Mappings
section, select
Provision Microsoft Entra ID Users
. Alternatively, this option may appear as
Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Grammarly
.
Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Microsoft Entra ID to Grammarly in the
Attribute-Mapping
section. The attributes selected as
Matching
properties are used to match the user accounts in Grammarly for update operations. If you choose to change the
matching target attribute
, you will need to ensure that the Grammarly API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the
Save
button to commit any changes.
To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the
scoping filter tutorial
.
To enable the Microsoft Entra ID provisioning service for Grammarly, change the
Provisioning Status
to
On
in the
Settings
section.
Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Grammarly by choosing the desired values in
Scope
in the Settings section.
When you are ready to provision, click
Save
.
This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in
Scope
in the
Settings
section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every forty minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra ID provisioning service is running.
Provisioning of already assigned users
If you already have team members in your Grammarly subscription and turn on provisioning, a reconciliation process needs to happen. As part of this process, Microsoft Entra ID will notify Grammarly of all assigned users. Grammarly will reconcile users already invited via a provisioning request from the identity provider and their status will be reflected on the
Members
page
. To determine users who haven’t been reconciled with Microsoft Entra ID, access the
Provisioning
page
. If there are users who haven’t yet been provisioned by the identity provider, the
Provisioning
page will show a warning banner. Click the
Download report
link to download a CSV file containing the list of members that haven’t yet been provisioned. This report can be used to bulk delete outstanding users, if appropriate, or for manual processing.
Monitoring Deployment
Once you’ve configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:
Use the
provisioning logs
to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully.
If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. You can learn more about quarantine states in this article by Microsoft:
Application provisioning in quarantine status
Resolve Issues
When assigning users and groups to Grammarly, you must select a role other than
Default Access
. Users with the Default Access role are excluded from provisioning and will be marked as not effectively entitled in the provisioning logs. If the only role available on the application is the default access role, you can
update the application manifest
to add additional roles.
When users are deactivated in Microsoft Entra ID, they will be deactivated in Grammarly. Users will not be able to log in to the application, but their data will remain available as an “inactive user.” After 30 days, their accounts will be deleted completely.","[""Step-by-Step Configuration Instructions"", ""Step-by-Step Configuration Instructions"", ""Click the"", ""Step 4"", ""Click""]",https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058948112-Configure-SCIM-provisioning-with-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Azure-AD,2025-08-11T20:33:39.474044+00:00,5509,True

You can configure System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) for your Grammarly subscription, which automatically provisions members and groups when they are assigned Grammarly application access at your identity provider if you are using a supported identity provider. The identity providers currently supported for SCIM-based provisioning are Okta, Azure AD, and OneLogin.
In order to use SCIM-based provisioning, you must be already using SAML single sign-on (SSO) for user authentication. For more information, please see this article:
Set up SAML single sign-on
When using SAML SSO, by default your identity provider does not communicate with Grammarly to create members or groups when you assign or unassign users to the application. Grammarly performs just-in-time (JIT) provisioning of the member’s account the first time a member signs in via your identity provider. With the enablement of SCIM-based provisioning, your identity provider will notify Grammarly when users are assigned or unassigned application access.
When you assign application access, your identity provider will communicate with Grammarly to create a member account and send an onboarding email to the user. When you unassign application access, your identity provider will communicate with Grammarly to invalidate any authenticated sessions and deactivate the member’s account. The Grammarly account will be suspended within an hour of receiving the deletion request and permanently deleted within 30 days.
Supported identity providers
The following identity providers can provision or de-provision members of your Grammarly subscription using SCIM:
Okta
Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
OneLogin
Rippling
Turning on provisioning with existing members
If you already have team members in your Grammarly subscription and you turn on provisioning, a reconciliation process needs to happen. As part of this process, your identity provider will notify Grammarly of all assigned users. Grammarly will reconcile users already invited via a provisioning request from the identity provider and their status will be reflected on the
Members
page. To determine users who haven’t been reconciled with the identity provider, access the
Provisioning
page. If there are users who haven’t yet been provisioned by the identity provider, the
Provisioning
page will show a warning banner. Click the
Download report
link to download a CSV file containing the list of members that haven’t yet been provisioned. This report can be used to bulk delete outstanding users, if appropriate, or for manual processing.
Note:
For some identity providers, the step to provision already assigned users may have to be triggered manually. See the identity-provider-specific steps for more information.
Turning on provisioning for groups
SCIM can be used to organize team members into groups for select identity providers. This allows you to sync your identity provider group configuration with your Grammarly subscription.
Note:
The SCIM group provisioning support is available for Grammarly Enterprise customers upon request. If you’re interested in enabling this feature, please contact your Customer Success Manager or
Grammarly Support team
.
Assigning a cost center to team members
SCIM can also be used to define the

Grammarly Pro and Business plans with an organizational domain and not using SSO
Managed by:
Admins
To enable your team members to seamlessly join your team plan, you can allow them to discover your plan and instantly join it when they sign up for a Grammarly account using your organization’s email domain. This means your colleagues will spend less time waiting for access, and it allows you to expand access to Grammarly to your whole team efficiently.
Alternatively, your team members can request to join your team plan directly from their accounts, and you can accept or decline their requests.
For admins:
You can set your preferred way for new members to join your plan on the
Invite Settings
page:
If you'd like to allow anyone with your organizational domain to discover and join your team plan, choose the
Anyone with the domain … can discover and join your account
option
.
Note:
For Grammarly Pro plans with one or two members, choosing this option will still require new members to request to join the team’s plan.
To have the option to approve or reject your team members’ requests to join your plan, check the box next to
Require admin approval
.
If you’d like further control over who can join your plan, select
Only invited colleagues can join your account
.
If the
Require admin approval
box is checked, team members cannot instantly join your team plan. Instead, they can submit requests to join, and you can then accept or decline their requests.
Admins can either accept requests directly from the email notifications they receive or review all pending requests on the corresponding page.
To access the membership requests page, navigate to the
Members
page and select the
Membership requests
tab at the top. From there, you can review the pending membership requests and accept or decline them. When a membership request is accepted, the person who submitted it will be notified.
Note:
Membership requests are automatically canceled if no action is taken within 30 days.
Billing process
If all seats in your team plan have been allotted, additional seats will be automatically added when more team members join by either discovering your plan at the sign-up or after you’ve accepted their requests to join. You will be charged for the additional seats within a 60-day period.
The charge date for the additional seats will be shown on the
Subscription
page under the number of additional seats in use.
You can update or reallocate seats anytime before that date. To learn more, check out this article:
About true-up billing
For team members:
Team members can instantly join their team’s plan when creating their Grammarly accounts if the following conditions are met:
Their email domain matches an active team plan that does not use SAML single sign-on (SSO) for authentication.
The admin has enabled the option for team members with matching domains to discover and join the plan.
To join your team’s plan, please follow the steps below:
Go to
www.grammarly.com/signup
Enter your name, your corporate email address, and a password. You may be prompted to verify your account by entering a six-digit verification code sent to your email address.

Custom roles is an enterprise feature that allows organizations to tailor account management permissions and access controls to fit their specific organizational requirements.

What are custom roles?
Custom roles are admin-defined roles that can be configured to have specific permissions within your Grammarly Enterprise account. Unlike predefined default roles (admin, account manager, user role with group manager permissions, user), which come with a fixed set of permissions, custom roles allow enterprise admins to mix and match permissions to create roles that suit their organization’s unique needs.

Common use cases
The custom roles feature has numerous applications. Here are a few common use cases that are particularly beneficial to explore:
Create an IT admin role
If you need to establish an account role capable of performing specific admin tasks—like configuring IT settings, including SSO and SCIM, and managing members—without granting full admin privileges, consider creating an IT admin role.
Enable only specific members to manage your license
Allow certain members to manage your subscription, invite and remove members, and get insights into how others are using Grammarly without them necessarily having full admin permissions to alter security controls, SSO configuration, or communication preferences such as brand tones.
Create a brand contributor role
You can create a brand contributor role for individuals who need to manage company-wide style rules or define organizational brand tones without unnecessary admin permissions to manage groups or see the team’s analytics. You can make the custom role for account management purposes as granular as it needs to be.
Frequently asked questions
Can a team member have more than one role?
No, each team member can have only one role.
Can a team member with a custom role also be assigned the group manager permissions for a certain group?
Yes, you can assign group manager permissions to members with custom roles.
Is there a limit to how many custom roles an admin can create?
No, admins can create as many custom roles as needed.
Can I modify the default roles?

67d2fbdede3f,train,article_0355,How can I turn off the Grammarly AI? Does Grammarly use trigger AI detectors?,general_inquiry,Common Questions,"The growing use of AI tools has raised concerns about AI plagiarism and prompted the adoption of AI detectors. We'd like to address some of the concerns regarding how Grammarly uses AI and promote ongoing dialogue on this emerging issue.
The difference between AI and generative AI
Since our founding in 2009, Grammarly has been harnessing the power of AI to improve your writing experience. Our foundational AI technology—integrating machine learning, natural language processing, and insights from human linguists—is designed to preserve your unique voice and message while improving your writing through suggestions for spelling, grammar, clarity, conciseness, and tone.
This AI technology is integral to the suggestions provided by our product. It does not change the substance of the writing, and it cannot be turned off separately from Grammarly.
In 2023, Grammarly introduced
optional
generative AI features that enable users to
produce new content
based on their inputs or prompts. This advancement reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting every phase of communication, from initial brainstorming to final draft.
These features are not turned on by default; they’re available
on-demand
, and users have full control over when and how to use them. These features can generate content and meaningfully change writing. Any user can turn off generative AI in the
Feature customization tab
in their account settings. For more information, refer to this guide:
Introducing generative AI assistance
.
The challenges of identifying AI-generated text
As the prevalence of AI tools grows, the landscape of AI detection tools is also evolving. While AI detectors can help assess whether text appears AI-generated, none today can reliably and conclusively determine whether AI was used to produce text. These tools should be considered
a single data point
rather than the sole source of evidence when investigating AI use and highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of how AI use fits into an organization’s academic or professional standards.
We recommend combining automatic AI detection with manual review, and encourage writers to track their writing process with
Grammarly Authorship
and
provide proper attribution
when they use AI.
Looking to the future, we see an opportunity for a collaborative dialogue among educators, professionals, and technology providers. We aim to contribute to developing clear guidelines that promote the responsible use of AI. Find more details in the resources linked below:

To resolve this issue, make sure that the Grammarly application is assigned to this specific user or that they belong to the appropriate group in your identity provider with access to Grammarly.
If you’re using SCIM provisioning, we recommend checking the identity provider provisioning logs for any errors and verifying
the status of this user.

Customization options
Grammarly for iPhone offers the following customization options:
Keyboard Layout
Grammarly for iPhone's ""Keyboard Layout"" feature allows you to customize your keyboard layout according to your preference. It offers a variety of layout options, including QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, and Workman. You can also easily switch between these layouts. This feature is especially useful for those who are familiar with different keyboard layouts or who want to try out new layouts to improve their typing speed and accuracy.
Emoji Suggestions
With this feature, you can easily find and use the perfect emoji to enhance your written communication. As you type, Grammarly suggests relevant emoji based on the words you are using, making it easy to add a bit of fun and personality to any message. Whether you're chatting with friends or sending a professional email, emoji suggestions can help you express yourself in a more engaging and effective way.
Emoji Key
The Emoji Key provides quick and convenient access to a wide range of expressive emoji. When this feature is activated, the Emoji Key appears next to the 123 key on your iPhone keyboard. With a simple tap, you can access a diverse collection of emoji to add personality, emotion, and visual flair to your messages.
Period Key
When this option is turned on, the Period Key appears conveniently between the spacebar and the Return key. With this placement, you can quickly and effortlessly insert periods at the end of sentences without the need for additional taps or switching to a different keyboard layout.
Synonyms
The Synonyms feature in Grammarly for iPhone enriches your writing by providing a quick and convenient way to explore alternative word choices. When this feature is turned on, you can easily access synonyms by placing the cursor next to a word. The synonyms will appear on the top bar of the Grammarly Keyboard.
Swipe Typing
The Swipe Typing feature in Grammarly for iPhone revolutionizes your typing experience by enabling faster and more intuitive text input. With this feature, you can effortlessly compose messages, emails, and documents by gliding your finger across the keyboard instead of tapping individual keys.
Delete Swipe by Word
The Delete Swipe by Word feature in Grammarly for iPhone simplifies the process of deleting text by allowing you to delete entire words with a single swipe. With this feature activated, you can effortlessly remove words or phrases by touching your finger to the Backspace key (the key to the right of ""m"") and immediately sliding it to the left. The farther you slide it, the more words will be selected and deleted. Instead of tediously deleting one character at a time, Grammarly intelligently recognizes your swipe gesture and instantly erases entire words, saving you time and effort.
Completions Bar
The Completions Bar feature in Grammarly for iPhone enhances your writing efficiency by providing intelligent word suggestions as you type. Located above the keyboard, the Completions Bar dynamically displays relevant word options based on the context of your text. As you type, Grammarly analyzes your input and offers predictive suggestions to help you complete your sentences with accuracy and speed. Simply select a suggested word from the Completions Bar to insert it into your text.
Auto-Capitaliztion
Grammarly intuitively recognizes the beginning of sentences, proper nouns, and other instances where capitalization is required. As you type, Grammarly takes care of capitalizing the first letter of each sentence and appropriate names, saving you the effort of manually correcting capitalization errors.
Enable Caps Lock
By enabling this feature, you can turn on the Caps Lock mode within your keyboard, allowing you to type in uppercase without having to hold the shift key continuously. This is especially useful when you need to emphasize a word, write acronyms, or enter text in all caps.
Note:

Auto-Correction
The Auto-Correction feature in Grammarly for iPhone ensures that your writing is free from spelling mistakes and typos by automatically applying common corrections as you type.
Undo Auto-Correction
This feature provides you with the flexibility to undo the automatically applied corrections and restore your original word or phrase. If you feel that the correction doesn't align with your intended meaning or if you prefer your original text, simply tap the Backspace key to revert the change.
Character Preview
If you tap and hold a particular key, Grammarly will display options for that character, such as an ""e"" with different accent marks above it. You can then slide over to the one you need. Whether it's an accented letter, punctuation mark, or other special characters, the Character Preview feature ensures that you choose the right character for your writing needs. This feature helps you avoid mistakes and enhances the accuracy of your text, particularly when working with foreign languages or specific formatting requirements.
Sound Feedback on Keypress
With this feature enabled, Grammarly generates a subtle sound effect when you press each key on the keyboard.
Haptic Feedback on Keypress
Grammarly utilizes the haptic technology in your iPhone to generate subtle vibrations when you press the keys on the keyboard. The haptic feedback adds a sense of physicality to your typing, creating a satisfying and responsive touch sensation.
Show Lowercase Keys
When enabled, this option ensures that the keyboard always shows the lowercase letters, regardless of the capitalization state. This helps you maintain a consistent visual reference of the lowercase alphabet, making it easier to recognize and select the appropriate keys while typing.
“.” Shortcut
Double-tapping the spacebar will insert a period followed by a space.
To turn any of these options on or off, switch the toggle next to them.

Grammarly’s Enterprise-tier licenses equip administrators with robust internal controls to manage user access, ensure compliance with licensing agreements, and improve security. These features provide new user sign-up controls leveraging organizational email domains, as well as service provider-initiated sign-in options and in-product messaging for individual Grammarly Free, Premium, and Pro users who share the same domain.

Controlling New User Signups
Domain Verification
Domain verification changes the account creation flow for new users visiting Grammarly for the first time. Once an email domain has been verified by Grammarly, the following will happen:
All new users creating accounts at
www.grammarly.com/signup
with a matching email domain will be routed to your organization’s SSO login page.
Individuals who have not been granted access to Grammarly in an identity provider will not be able to create Grammarly accounts using their work email addresses.
Individuals who have been granted access to Grammarly in an identity provider will have Grammarly accounts automatically created for them and will instantly join your Grammarly license.
This process ensures that:
All employees access the correct enterprise license.
There are no individuals inadvertently creating personal Grammarly accounts using their work email addresses.
Only those who have been granted access to Grammarly in an identity provider can join your Grammarly license.
You can restrict domains that should not be used for user registrations.
Note:
If your company uses both top-level domains and subdomains, they will need to be verified independently. For example, verifying the email domain @acme.com will not affect individuals with the @marketing.acme.com email address. You can selectively apply these settings per domain.
Managing Existing Users
The functionality described below allows Enterprise account owners to enable in-app messaging for Grammarly’s existing user base, offering individuals with matching email domains the option to either join the Enterprise license or change their Grammarly account email address to a personal one.
Domain verification described above is a prerequisite to continue with either Domain Capture or Invite Capture.
Domain Capture
Domain capture enables a requirement for all users with a matching email domain to either join the Enterprise license or change the email address associated with their Grammarly account. They will not be able to continue using Grammarly and will receive an in-product notification with the options detailed below:
If an individual had a personal Grammarly Pro or Premium subscription before joining the Enterprise license, their subscription will be paused for the duration of their membership. They will have the option to request a prorated refund on their
Subscription
page.
These settings will come into effect the next time the end user signs in to Grammarly.
Invite Capture
Invite capture differs from Domain Capture in that it impacts only
those invited to the license
, not everyone with the corresponding email domain.
Organizations not utilizing SSO can also leverage invite capture to prompt invited members to join their organizational license.
These settings will come into effect the next time the end user signs in to Grammarly.

Document domains are available with Grammarly Pro, Grammarly Premium, Grammarly Business, and Grammarly for Education.
About domains
You can select the style of the document that best corresponds to the type of writing you are checking in order to get the most accurate and relevant suggestions. Grammarly offers six document domains:
General
Academic
Business
Email
Creative
Casual
General
is a good one to start with if you are unsure about which style to pick.
All the styles apply most of Grammarly’s spelling, grammar, and punctuation checks. Below is a list that details the variations among the styles, from most to least formal:
Academic
Academic is the strictest style of writing. On top of catching grammar and punctuation issues, Grammarly will make suggestions around passive voice, contractions, and informal pronouns (I, you), and will point out unclear antecedents (e.g., sentences starting with “This is…”).
Business
The business style setting checks the text against formal writing criteria. However, unlike the Academic domain, it allows the use of some informal expressions, informal pronouns, and unclear antecedents.
General
This is the default style and uses a medium level of strictness.
Email
The email genre is similar to the General domain and helps ensure that your email communication is engaging. In addition to catching grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes, Grammarly also points out the use of overly direct language that may sound harsh to a reader.
Casual
Casual is designed for informal types of writing and ignores most style issues. It does not flag contractions, passive voice, informal pronouns, who-versus-whom usage, split infinitives, or run-on sentences. This style is suitable for personal communication.
Creative
This is the most permissive style. It catches grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes but allows some leeway for those who want to intentionally bend grammar rules to achieve certain effects. Creative doesn’t flag sentence fragments (missing subjects or verbs), wordy sentences, colloquialisms, informal pronouns, passive voice, incomplete comparisons, or run-on sentences.
Changing domains
To change your document domain in the Grammarly Editor, click

⋮
icon
next to the corresponding style rule set, and select
Settings
.
Click on
Anyone in the selected groups
, select a user group you wish to assign to the style rule set, and click
Save
. You can also choose
Anyone in my organization
to assign the style rule set to all team members.
Note:
A single user group can have multiple style rule sets assigned to it. If you assign another style rule set to a group that already has one assigned to it, they will be getting suggestions from both style rule sets.
Can I create multiple style rule sets?
Note:
Multiple style rule sets are not included in Grammarly Pro plans. Members of Grammarly Pro plans can create one style rule set.
Members of Grammarly Business plans can create up to 50 style rule sets. To create additional style rule sets, follow these steps:
Go to the
Style Rule Sets
page
and click
Create Rule Set
in the upper-right corner.
In the window that appears next, enter the name of the style rule set, assign it to a user group or to your whole organization, and click Save.
Can I see how often the style rules are being used?
To check the number of times each style rule was viewed, accepted, and dismissed, go to the
Style Rule Sets
page, click on a style rule set,
and click on a specific rule. These metrics are also shown under the
Viewed
and
Accepted
columns on the style rule set page.
Can I change the style guide logo?
The style guide logo appears on the suggestion cards from all style rule sets. To upload your custom image, go to the
Style Rule Sets
page and click on the logo
to the left of
Style Rule Sets
.
Can I limit the style rules to certain websites?
You can specify a list of URLs where you’d like the style rule suggestions to appear. You may find this useful if your style rules are geared toward external communication (for example, writing publicly on LinkedIn) but less important for internal communication (for example, Slack messages).
To create an allowed list, follow these steps:
Go to the
Style Rule Sets
page and click on a style rule set.
On the next page, click on the three dots
⋮
icon in the upper-right corner and choose
Settings
:
Under
Show suggestions for this rule set on:

Save
. On all other websites, style rule suggestions will be hidden unless the user clicks the Grammarly widget in the lower-right corner of the text field.
Formatting tips:
google.com (no “www”)
:
Use this format to include all associated URLs, including www.google.com, mail.google.com, docs.google.com, etc.
docs.google.com:
Use this format to include only the page found at a specific URL.
How do I activate or deactivate a style rule set?
Go to the
Style Rule Sets
page, click on the three dots
⋮
icon next to the corresponding style rule set, and click
Deactivate

How do I delete a style rule set?
Go to the
Style Rule Sets
page, click on the three dots
⋮
icon next to the corresponding style rule set, and click
Delete
.
How do I come up with new style rules?
Take a moment to brainstorm some common writing issues among your team members. These might include customer or product names that are often miswritten, special terms that get used incorrectly, or words that your company prefers not to use.
When you specify the original text, consider adding a few versions of it if your team tends to miswrite it in different ways.
When setting up a new style rule, be sure to account for all forms of the word or phrase, including plurals and different tenses.
As you and your team begin interacting with the suggestions generated by your style rules, you’ll likely want to make adjustments. You can change, add, or delete a style rule at any time.
What access do team members with different roles have?
Team members with the
admin
or
account manager
roles have editing permissions for all style rules functionality: they can create, edit, or remove style rules assigned to the whole organization, or to specific groups. They can also see statistics associated with any existing style rule.
Team members with the
group manager
permissions can create and edit only the style rule sets assigned to the user group they have permissions to manage. Group managers can view the style rules assigned to other groups or to the whole organization but can’t make any changes to them. They also won’t see any statistics associated with the style rules that are not applicable to their groups. Group managers can duplicate any existing style rule set. However, it can be assigned only to the user group they have permissions to manage.
Note:
The group manager permissions are available only to Grammarly Enterprise customers.
If you’re a Grammarly Enterprise admin, you can also create a
custom role
for individuals who need to manage company-wide style rules or define organizational brand tones without unnecessary admin permissions to manage groups or see the team’s analytics. To learn more, check out this article:

Admins, account managers, group managers, and members with designated custom roles
The brand tones feature allows you to set a tone profile that customizes Grammarly’s feedback to your organization’s unique brand voice.
Topics covered in this article:
What is a tone?
How can Grammarly help my team with brand tones?
Getting started

What is a tone?
While the grammar, spelling, clarity, and conciseness of your writing are important factors to ensure better writing, the tone of your writing can also change how people understand it. For example, if someone wanted to apologize, they could say “I’m terribly sorry about that.” Or they could say “Oops. I’m sorry!” Both sentences convey the same message but with different tones.
Said differently, you can think of a tone as the mood or emotion a piece of writing conveys. To learn more, check out this blog post:
What Is Tone in Writing?
How can Grammarly help my team with brand tones?
Grammarly analyzes the tone of your writing using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI). You can set up a brand tone profile for your teams or organization. You can assign different tones as on-brand or off-brand. Your team will then see real-time feedback about their tone as they write to help them stay on-brand.
Getting started
Go to your
Home
page.
Click on the
Writing
tab and choose
Brand tones
.
On the next page, c
lick
Set up tone profile
.
In the window that appears next, select the sentences that best reflect how you would want your team to sound in each scenario:
After responding to several prompts, you’ll be able to review your answers. If you’re satisfied, proceed to the next step by clicking
Analyze Answers
.
We’ll generate a recommended tone profile for you.
Click
View tone profile
to finish the process.
You’ll then see the recommended tones added to your tone profile. From here, you can edit the descriptions for tones, delete them entirely, or add more tones to your tone profile by clicking
Add Tones
in the upper-right corner.
That’s it! Your team members will now see tone recommendations as they write.
How do I add a tone to my tone profile?
To add tones to your tone profile, follow these steps:
Click
Add tones
in the upper-right corner.
In the window that appears next, choose whether the tones you’d like to add should be
on-brand or off-brand. Tones labeled as on-brand will be encouraged for your team, while tones labeled off-brand will be discouraged.
Select a tone group from the dropdown list.
If you’d like to exclude a specific tone from the tone group, you can uncheck the box next to it.
Add an explanation or use the description generated by Grammarly and click
Save.
Can I change the explanation for a tone in my tone profile?
To change an explanation, click the
pencil icon
under a group of tones:
In the window that appears next, you can edit the text under
Explanation for tones
. Sometimes, Grammarly may be able to autogenerate a description that you can then modify. If an autogenerated description is available, you can click on
Custom description generated by Grammarly
at the bottom of the window to insert it.
Can I limit the brand tones feedback to certain websites?
Yes, you can specify a list of URLs where you’d like the tone profile feedback to appear. You may find this useful if your tone profile is geared toward external communication (for example, writing publicly on Twitter) but less important for internal communication (for example, Slack messages).
To create an allowed list of websites, go to the
Brand Tones
page, click on the three dots in the upper-right corner, and choose
Settings
:
In the window that appears next, choose
Specific websites
, add the URLs of the websites where you would like your tone profile feedback to appear, and confirm the changes by clicking
Save URL settings
.
On all other websites, your team members will see detected tones without on-brand or off-brand labels.
Formatting tips:
google.com (without “www”):
Use this format to include all associated URLs, including www.google.com, mail.google.com, docs.google.com, etc.
docs.google.com:
Use this format to include only the page found at a specific URL.
How do I create additional tone profiles?
Note:
This option is not included in Grammarly Pro plans. Members of Grammarly Pro plans can create one brand tone profile.
To create an additional tone profile, follow these steps:
Go to your
Home
page.
Click on the
Writing
tab and choose
Brand tones
.
On the next page, click on the three dots in the upper-right corner and choose
Create tone profile
:
In the new window that appears, click
Create tone profile
.
Enter the tone profile name and select the member groups it should be assigned to.
If you want the tone profile to work on certain websites, choose
Specific websites
, add the website URLs, and click
Save
.
Note:
A single member group can have only one brand tone profile assigned. If you assign a different brand tone profile to a group that already has one assigned, it will override the previous one. On the other hand, a single brand tone profile can be assigned to multiple member groups. If you haven’t created any groups yet, you can refer to this article to do so:
Organize team members into groups
To create more tone profiles, go to the
Brand Tones
page and click
Create tone profile
in the upper-right corner.
What access do team members with different roles have?
Team members with the
admin
and
account manager
roles have editing permissions for all brand tones functionality: they can create, edit, or delete brand tone profiles assigned to all user groups.
Team members with
group manager permissions
can create and edit brand tone profiles only for the member groups they are assigned to manage. Group managers can view the brand tone profiles assigned to other groups, but can’t make any changes to them.
If you’re a Grammarly Enterprise admin, you can also create a
custom role
that grants permissions to manage brand tones for your organization, but without full admin privileges. You can learn more in this article:
About custom roles
Note:
The group manager permissions and custom roles are available only to Grammarly Enterprise customers. Interested in upgrading to an Enterprise account?
Contact our Sales team
.
Team members with the
user
role can view the brand tone profile assigned to them, but can’t make any changes.

Below, we’ve provided a selection of troubleshooting steps to follow if Grammarly's on-demand generative AI features are not appearing where you expect them to be.
There are several ways to access the generative AI features, including highlighting text to see an in-line entry point, clicking on the green lightbulb icon near the Grammarly icon, and clicking on the side panel of the Grammarly Editor.
Step 1: Make sure you're using a supported product offering
To start off, please ensure you’re using a supported product offering. We’ve created a comprehensive list of product offerings where we’ve released generative AI:
Generative AI is available when using…
Not currently available when using…
Grammarly for Windows
Grammarly for Mac
The Grammarly Editor
Grammarly for Chrome
Grammarly for Microsoft Edge
Grammarly for iOS (iPhone + iPad)
Grammarly for Android
Grammarly for Microsoft Office
Grammarly for Microsoft Word on Mac
Grammarly for Safari
Grammarly for Firefox
Step 2: Check your Account Settings
If you already use a supported product offering, please make sure that generative AI is turned on in your account settings. Go to the
Feature customization
tab and make sure each option is switched on:
If the options on this page are all gray, and you cannot switch them on or off, please
contact Support
so that our team can investigate this matter further.
You can also adjust these settings in the Grammarly for Windows and Mac Settings window and the Grammarly browser extension dropdown menu:

Dropdown menu > Generative AI
Step 3: Check your local software and security settings
Grammarly's generative AI assistance might be blocked by your local security software or network settings. Please ensure that your antivirus and firewall software allows access to the following internet addresses:
treatment.grammarly.com (ports 80 and 443)
gnar.grammarly.com (ports 80 and 443)

data.grammarly.com (ports 80 and 443)
auth.grammarly.com (ports 80 and 443)
*.grammarly.net (ports 80 and 443)
You or your IT administrator may need to add exception rules for the above addresses to your firewall and antivirus software.
Step 4: Check that you have enough generative AI prompts
If you have used all your allocated prompts for the month, Grammarly’s generative AI features will no longer appear when you highlight your text.

a6c3f480c4c7,train,article_0097,Docs: Grammarly’s new AI writing surface—user guide,general_inquiry,Docs,"Docs is a new AI-powered writing surface designed to help you brainstorm, compose, edit, and refine documents with ease. Whether you're writing a blog post, crafting a research essay, or preparing a professional report, docs provides a flexible space enriched with Grammarly AI writing agents to support your writing and revision needs.
What you can do in docs
Docs combines Grammarly’s writing support with a modern, intuitive, and agent-enabled editor. Within a document, you can access a variety of AI-powered agents to help you write clearly, confidently, and efficiently:
AI Chat
:
Lets you ask questions, conduct research, rewrite content, generate ideas, or refine messaging instantly using conversational AI embedded into the document surface.
Grammarly Proofreader
:
Delivers real-time suggestions to improve grammar, clarity, tone, word choice, and overall correctness as you write.
Paraphraser
:
Rewrites your content in a variety of relevant and engaging tones while preserving original meaning.
Expert Review
:
Provides personalized, in-depth feedback from relevant subject matter experts to enhance argumentation strength, structure, and credibility.
Reader Reactions
:
Predicts how your selected audience is likely to interpret your content, surfacing potential key takeaways and remaining questions they may ask.
Humanizer
:
Transforms your AI writing to sound natural, genuine, and human. It removes robotic phrasing and keeps your voice authentic for emails, proposals, or blog posts.
Citation Finder
:
Examines the quality and substance of arguments in a piece of writing and identifies publicly available sources that support, conflict with, or contradict the points being made in the writing, with easy-to-find links and pre-formatted citations in APA, MLA, and other common styles.
AI Detector
:
Identifies sections of text that may have been generated by AI, helping maintain transparency and integrity in your writing.
Plagiarism Checker
:
Checks your content against academic, web, and professional sources to ensure originality and proper attribution.
AI Grader
:
Evaluates writing quality based on predefined inputs based on an instructor and/or rubric—offering a sample “pregrade” and actionable tips for improvement.
These tools are built into the docs experience and work seamlessly while you write. You can access them by clicking the side panel with agent icons:
How to create a document
To create a new document:
Visit
https://app.grammarly.com
Click
New Doc
at the top of the page.
If you don’t see the option to create a new document, it may be because

is not enabled in your account. To enable it, go to the
account hub
:

Document labels
Documents created using the older Grammarly Editor will be marked with a
Classic
label. New documents created in the current editor will not have this label.
Important:
Titles are not added automatically. Be sure to enter a title when you create a document. This helps improve searchability, especially when working with multiple documents.
How to format your text
The new writing surface gives you several options to structure and style your content:
Core capabilities
Write in plain or styled formats
Add and customize tables
Insert elements using slash commands (e.g.,
/table
,
/heading
)
Create and nest sections to organize content hierarchically
Keyboard shortcuts
Speed up your workflow with essential shortcuts:
Action
macOS
Windows
Bold
⌘+B
Ctrl+B
Italic
⌘+I
Ctrl+I
Underline
⌘+U
Ctrl+U
Undo
⌘+Z
Ctrl+Z
Redo
⇧+⌘+Z
Ctrl+Y
These shortcuts work across most document elements and are especially useful when editing text quickly.
Paragraph styles
You can style your content using predefined formats:
Use the
style dropdown
in the toolbar or type a
slash command
to apply:
Heading 1 (
/h1
)
Heading 2 (
/h2
)
Heading 3 (
/h3
)
Quote (
/quote
)
Code (
/code
)
Paragraph (
/paragraph
)
These styles help structure your document, especially when creating outlines, long-form writing, or instructional content.
Manual text formatting
You can also format your text manually using the toolbar or keyboard shortcuts. Available options include:
Bold, italic, underline
Bulleted and numbered lists
Checkboxes
Inline code and code blocks
Tip:
You can select multiple text blocks and apply the same formatting in bulk. This is useful for applying consistent styling across sections of your document.
Using the slash ( / ) command
The slash command is a versatile tool that lets you insert and format elements without leaving your keyboard. Just type
/
and a list of available options will appear.
You can use slash commands to:
Apply formatting, such as
/heading
,
/bullet
, or
/quote
Insert content, such as
/table
or
/image
Quickly search for commands by continuing to type after the slash
This feature is especially helpful for users who prefer a keyboard-first experience and want to avoid switching between mouse and keyboard.
How to proofread your text
While writing, you’ll notice red underlines appear in your text. These indicate critical suggestions, such as grammar, spelling, or word choice issues. If you’re on a paid plan, you will also likely see blue underlines for more complex clarity and tone suggestions.
To review a suggestion:
Click the underline to open the suggestion card.
Click the suggestion card to accept or dismiss the suggestion.
For a more comprehensive review, open the
Grammarly Proofreader
agent. It will analyze your entire document and present recommendations in dynamic categories that are tailored to your writing context.
To use the proofreader agent:
Click the
bars on the left-hand panel
of the document.
Review the suggestions by category.
Hover over suggested changes to preview them in context. You can undo individual edits as needed.
This tool is especially useful for in-depth editing, polishing, or preparing your document for publication or sharing.
To continue polishing your text, you can also use the other agents: Expert Review, AI Grader, and Paraphraser.
How to export your document
To export your document:
Click the
menu icon
(three dots) in the upper-right corner of the docs interface.
Select
Print & Export
.
Choose
Export to PDF
.
If you prefer to continue editing in another platform, you can copy and paste the content into Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

Grammarly Enterprise plans
Managed by:
Admins
Grammarly is committed to
strong data privacy principles
for all users. You can specify additional restrictions for your team on what content or data Grammarly can access.
The application controls feature allows Enterprise admins to specify which desktop applications Grammarly will not run on. If an application is added to the blocklist, your team members will not be able to use Grammarly on that specific desktop application.
Interested in upgrading to an Enterprise account?
Contact our Sales team
.
To configure application controls, follow these steps:
Go to your
Home
page, open the
Organization
tab →
Enterprise Security
→
Domains and apps
.
To add an application to the blocklist, click
Add to block list
at the top of the page.
In the window that appears next, choose the
Application
option and specify the exact filename for a Mac or Windows application you’d like Grammarly to be blocked from accessing in the
Filename
field. To block Grammarly in an application on both operating systems, you need to add each application filename to the blocklist separately.
Specify on which level this control will be applied:
If you want to restrict Grammarly usage in the specified application for every member in your organization, select
Entire organization.
If you want to restrict Grammarly usage in the application only for specific member groups, select
Specific groups
and choose which groups this setting should be applied to. Optionally, you can select
Make this an admin controlled group
if you also want to limit the ability to delete a specified group or remove members from that group only to admins. You can learn more in this article:
How to organize members into groups
Click

Once you save these settings, Grammarly will not run in the applications you specify.
Note:
This feature is implemented for Grammarly for Windows and Grammarly for Mac only.
You can always remove applications from the blocklist on the
Domains and apps
page by clicking on the trash bin icon next to the application you’d like to remove from the list.
Naming conventions for applications control
When adding an application to the blocklist, make sure to use the correct syntax for the application name, which varies between Windows and macOS operating systems.
For applications that run on
Windows
, use the executable name (this is usually something like “application_name.exe”) to specify the application you want to block Grammarly from running. For applications that run on
macOS
, use the application’s unique bundle identifier (bundle ID).
How to find an application’s bundle ID on a Mac
Open
Terminal
on your Mac and run the following command:
osascript -e 'id of app ""Application Name""'
where
Application Name
is the exact name of the app, as it appears in the doc or in the Applications folder.
Important:
If your organization uses both Windows and Mac computers and you wish to block the same application on both operating systems, you need to add the application name with the appropriate syntax for each operating system separately. To do so, enter an application name and click
Save

Writing Sessions:
The number of writing sessions that took place during the selected date range. A writing session occurs when a team member uses Grammarly to actively write or edit text. A session automatically ends after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Note:
Writing sessions do not reflect a user’s productivity or quality of work because everyone’s working style is different. Some team members may write for long stretches of time, while others may break up their writing time. This data is available to help put the

value in perspective.
Sessions Improved
: The percentage of writing sessions that were improved out of writing sessions that had at least one error and took place during the selected date range. A writing session is considered improved if there are fewer mistakes in the text at the end of a session than at the beginning.
Note:
The
Sessions Improved
statistic is not reflective of a team member’s writing ability. It’s intended to help you understand which team members get the most value out of Grammarly. If a team member has a low percentage of improved sessions, it may mean that they had fewer writing issues identified by Grammarly during the selected time period.

fdcc0b6d7667,train,article_0408,WebSockets Support Q&A for System Administrators,general_inquiry,Grammarly for Microsoft Office,"This article is meant to assist your system or network administrator with enabling WebSockets on your system and on your Internet Network. Your network or system administrator is a person or a provider who administers your local network, your ISP, or your computer settings.
Q: What does Grammarly need in order to function correctly?
A: Besides HTTPS requests, Grammarly products use WebSockets to communicate with the text checking service. The WebSockets use HTTP and HTTPS, with the corresponding ports of 80 and 443. You can read more about WebSockets here:
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket
www.websocket.org/aboutwebsocket.html
Q: We have ports 80 and 443 opened for any connections, but Grammarly encounters issues with WebSockets. What do we do?
A: In order to work with your firewall correctly, WebSockets needs these ports to be “opened” and also needs some support on the firewall/proxy level.
After establishing a connection, a browser issues an HTTP request with an Upgrade header, which is a hop-by-hop header, i.e. it is meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and it is neither stored by caches nor forwarded by proxies by default. If a proxy/firewall is not aware of WebSockets and it doesn't forward it further (making some other effort alongside, like keeping the connection active), then it is impossible to establish a connection.
Please consult your proxy/firewall documentation about how to enable support for WebSockets.
Q: We have protocol/domain/URL based firewall rules, what should we allow for Grammarly to work properly?
A: Besides our HTTPS services (
*.grammarly.com
,
*.grammarly.io
,
*.grammarly.net
) for WebSockets, we use the following endpoints:

Grammarly handles user-provided search terms for the explicit purpose of transmitting that data in order to return relevant search results. User-provided search terms
are not
retained by Grammarly and when used with partner APIs are handled according to their respective privacy policies.

If you have DLP enabled, please note that Grammarly does not sanitize user-provided search terms and text field inputs used by app actions and partner APIs.

Admins can select a time interval in units of days (i.e., 14 days, 30 days).
What are the benefits of using Session Timeout?
Session Timeout protects your organization’s account from unwanted account takeovers. Periodic forced re-authentication means reducing the time window when an attacker can gain unauthorized access to an account.
Additionally, Session Timeout ensures regular re-engagement for accounts using SaaS spend optimization platforms, showing more accurate account usage insights for users who might otherwise be inadvertently de-provisioned.
For which types of Grammarly accounts is Session Timeout currently available?

6fa8644963ff,train,article_0435,AI Detector user guide,general_inquiry,Agents,"The AI detection feature is created to empower our users with tools for responsible AI usage. It is your authenticity safeguard—it identifies text written and/or modified by major AI models, like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, helping you ensure originality and meet academic, editorial, or institutional standards. Whether you're verifying your own work or reviewing others’, this feature adds clarity and confidence to the presubmission and review process.
AI detection is a paid feature that is available in several parts of the Grammarly experience, depending on your plan:
Via an agent in docs, Grammarly’s AI writing surface (Premium/Pro users; learn more below)
Via the Grammarly browser extension within Google Docs (Premium, Pro, Grammarly Business, and Grammarly for Education plans)—Once you install the Grammarly browser extension on your preferred web browser, you’ll be able to access AI Detection from the “Check for plagiarism and AI text” entry point within the Grammarly suggestion panel in Google Docs:
Via the Grammarly for Mac and Grammarly for Windows desktop clients (Premium, Pro, Grammarly Business, and Grammarly for Education plans)—Once you install Grammarly on your preferred desktop, you’ll be able to access AI Detection from the plagiarism checker feature within Microsoft Word. To check your document for plagiarism and to see if some of the content may be flagged as AI-generated, open the Grammarly widget and click the quotation marks icon:
Grammarly will then show the probability of your text being flagged as AI-generated and underline the questionable text:
Each entry point offers the same value: Grammarly’s AI detection shows the percentage of text that appears AI-generated and offers guidance on interpreting the results responsibly. Although it doesn't explain why the text may be flagged, it helps users gauge, before submission, the likelihood of their text being flagged. The percentage result should not be used as an objective source of truth, as AI detection of any kind can be prone to errors.
Using the AI Detection agent within docs, Grammarly’s AI writing surface
If you’re a Grammarly Pro or Grammarly Premium user, the AI detection feature is available to you as the AI Detector agent in docs, Grammarly’s AI writing surface.
To initiate the agent, click the AI Detector icon in the side panel on the right:
Grammarly will then display the likelihood of parts of your text being flagged as AI-generated, with separate sections marked using the bars on the left side panel:
If you use generative AI when working on your text, AI Detector offers you an option to generate a citation. Simply click on the Generate citation button, which will take you to
the citation generator
, which will help you get well-formatted APA, MLA, and Chicago-style citations.
As you move through the specific passages that were flagged by the AI Detector agent as possibly AI, you can click the Mark as added button if you choose to add citations. The count on the right-hand side of the screen in docs will update in real time, helping you track where you’ve made modifications to your text and/or added a citation.
Note:
If you are working with other Grammarly agents in docs to rewrite your text, it is likely that the AI Detection agent will flag your content as AI-generated. That is because rewrites from the Proofreader, Expert Review, Paraphraser, and Humanizer agents come from our LLM. If you are concerned about being flagged for inappropriate AI use, we suggest that you refrain from using our agents to rewrite your content; instead, focus on using agents to guide feedback that you manually incorporate.
Detailed FAQs
What does the % score mean?
The score represents the percentage of scanned text that is likely AI-generated, based on our extensive machine learning training model. Our model is trained on hundreds of thousands of human and AI-generated texts. Grammarly breaks your text into smaller sections, checking each section against the model for patterns that are typically present in AI text (language patterns, syntax, and complexity). Grammarly then returns a percentage score, indicating how much of the provided text appears AI-generated. It assesses whether text resembles AI-generated writing; like other AI text checkers, it cannot provide a definitive conclusion.
How accurate is the score?
The AI detection score is an averaged estimate of the amount of AI-generated text that is likely contained in a given document or piece of writing. Rigorous testing was done to ensure that the model is directionally accurate at identifying AI-generated text. Shorter passages are slightly harder to measure for an accurate score than longer passages.
Like all AI detectors, the AI detection feature is not 100% accurate and should not be used as a definitive assessment of whether AI-generated text is present. The score itself should be viewed as an average estimate rather than a definitive percentage assessment.
I have not used AI-generated text in my document, but Grammarly is still saying that I have AI text in my writing. Why?
The AI detection model is optimized to minimize false positives, as we believe that incorrectly identifying human-generated text as AI-generated is more detrimental than failing to accurately catch AI-generated text. That said, there may be instances in which the human-generated language patterns, syntax, and complexity mirror those of AI-generated text more closely. We expect these instances to be very rare, but as with any AI detector, the results should always be viewed within a broader context and not taken as an objective source of truth.
If my professor uses a different AI detector to scan student writing, will the percentage score be the same?
The AI detection feature uses a proprietary in-house model, so the scores may differ from those of other solutions like Turnitin, GPTZero, Copyleaks, and others. You should not view any scores from Grammarly’s AI detection as a clear indication that your professor will see the same score when they run it through their preferred AI detector. However, our model is trained similarly to some of the other most accurate and used detectors, so we believe the scores should be directionally aligned.
How does AI detection distinguish between AI-generated content, content that is modified by generative AI, and human-written text that is edited with other agents?
Because our AI detection model has been trained solely on human-generated and AI-generated text from LLM providers, traditional, nongenerative corrections in the form of Grammarly red and blue underlines should typically not impact the percentage score. However, using more sophisticated Grammarly writing agents in docs, including the Grammarly proofreader, or using the Grammarly generative AI assistant in Google Docs and Word to meaningfully rewrite sentences and full paragraphs will raise the percentage score. The model is also more likely to assign a higher percentage of AI-generated text in a given passage if it’s been generated by an outside LLM provider (such as ChatGPT or Gemini). That said, paraphrasing edits with Grammarly and other providers are performed by LLMs, so those actions should still lead to some percentage of AI-generated text being triggered in the AI detection.
How can I reduce my document's AI score?
Currently, we do not offer a dedicated feature to reduce the AI score in user content. Grammarly users who use the AI detection feature should view the results as a data point in deciding how they may want to edit, rephrase, and attribute sources properly to reduce the risk of inappropriate AI use.",[],https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/28936304999949-AI-Detector-user-guide,2025-08-11T20:46:16.067130+00:00,7649,False

Grammarly for Windows
For Grammarly for Windows to work on your website or application, the textual content must be made visible to accessibility. Please make sure that there's no parent control in the accessibility tree that has zero height or width.
Native applications:
Use
Accessibility Insights for Windows
to check that the text field properly supports
UI Automation Text Pattern
.
If there's a scroll in the text field, check the
UI Automation Scroll Control Pattern
as well.
Websites or Electron-based applications:
Any HTML-based UI has accessibility support by default. Please make sure that the text field is visible to accessibility and that there are no parent elements in the accessibility tree with zero height or width.
Grammarly doesn't initialize in
input
fields. Please use
contenteditable
or
textarea
tags and make sure the width is more than 150px.
Grammarly for Mac
For Grammarly for Mac to work on your website, the textual content must be made visible to accessibility by calling
setAccessibilityElement
on the corresponding NSView.
We also recommend using NSTextView for implementing text editing, as it should provide the required accessibility functionality out of the box. Otherwise, the custom view must adopt
NSAccessibilityNavigableStaticText
protocol,
post
notifications about its value and layout changes, and additionally implement a few more accessibility methods:
accessibilitySelectedTextRange()
setAccessibilitySelectedTextRange()
For multipage interfaces each page needs to satisfy the requirements above and additionally implement:
accessibilitySharedCharactersRange()
accessibilitySharedTextUIElements()
You can use the Accessibility Inspector tool (
Main menu
>
Xcode
>
Open Developer Tool
>
Accessibility Inspector
) to see how your application is represented in the accessibility system.
Note:
If your app is Electron-based, we mainly support Electron 12+ for applications available in the App Store and Electron 16+ for other applications.

Grammarly Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans
Managed by:
Admins, account managers, group managers, and members with designated custom roles
We introduced new style rules features to help you create the most precise and relevant style guide suggestions for your team:
Use the asterisk symbol (*) as a placeholder in the tex
t
Case-sensitive original text
Lowercase replacement text at the start of a sentence
Context awareness
Related materials
Use the asterisk symbol (*) as a placeholder in the text
With this feature, you can use the asterisk symbol (*) as a placeholder for a word in a style rule.
For example, instead of specifying “give me the green light” in the
Original text
field, you can use text with a placeholder: “give * the green light.” The asterisk symbol will replace any word in the original text so that this style rule will cover “give me the green light,” “give us the green light,” “give her the green light,” etc.
To add a placeholder, enter “
*
” in the
Original text
field and click
Use “
*
” as a placeholder in the text
in the dropdown menu that appears or press Enter:
Case-sensitive original text
When creating a style rule, you can mark the text in the
Original text
field as case-sensitive. This way, the rule will only apply to text that matches the capitalization of the original text you specified.
For example, you can create a rule that suggests replacing the acronym “SOAP” with the full definition—“Simple Object Access Protocol.” If you make the original text case-sensitive, the rule will only be applied when the all-caps “SOAP” acronym is typed; it won’t be activated if your team members write the word “soap.”
To create a case-sensitive rule, check the box next to
Original text is case-sensitive
under
Formatting options:
Lowercase replacement text at the start of a sentence
This feature lets you specify that the word or phrase you’d like your team to use should not be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence. This is particularly important for brand names or other proper nouns that require specific capitalization.
For example, you can create a style rule for your team members to always use the spelling “iPhone,” and mark “iPhone” as lowercase at the beginning of a sentence. This way, Grammarly won’t suggest capitalizing “iPhone” when it’s the first word in a sentence.
To use this feature, check the box next to
Replacement text in lowercase at the start of a sentence
under
Formatting options
:
Context awareness
This feature allows you to add context keywords to your style rule. In this case, the rule will only be activated if the sentence contains the keywords you added. This can help you ensure your style guide suggestions are provided to your team members in the most appropriate context.
For example, if you don’t want your team members to use the word “dictionary” when they’re referring to your company style guide, you can add your company name or other relevant words as context keywords for the corresponding style rule. In this case, your team members will see suggestions not to write “I found it in the company dictionary” or “It’s in the AcmeCo dictionary,” but the rule won’t apply if they write “It’s in the dictionary.”
To add context keywords to your style rule, click on
Formatting options
and type the words in the field under
Context awareness
:
Related materials
You can link relevant materials to your style rules as a way of providing your team members with additional context or explanations.
To add a link to your style rule, click on
Related Materials
, insert the link in the
Link
field, and optionally add the
Display name
:
Once you do so, your team members will see a writing suggestion with a clickable hyperlink:

ed40fbd528a3,train,article_0054,How can I keep my Grammarly account secure?,general_inquiry,Fraud FAQ,"We know you care about the security of your Grammarly account. So do we. To that end, here are our recommendations for keeping your account and personal information safe.
Use a strong password and ensure it is unique to Grammarly
Your password is a key piece of information that keeps your account safe. To help ensure your account stays safe and secure, we recommend using a password that:
Is unique to your Grammarly account and hasn’t been used on other services.
Has at least 8 characters in it, the longer the better! A phrase made up of multiple words can be a secure choice.
Is not a word in the dictionary, a name, or other personal information like a birthday, address, or anniversary.
Doesn’t contain memorable keyboard paths like “1234abcd” or “qwerty123” and doesn’t use repetitive characters such as “aaa” or “zzz.”
Isn’t known to be commonly used on other websites or been previously
exposed in a data breach
.
Does not contain common substitutions such as “$” for “s” and “8” for “B.”
We recommend you keep your password in a safe place. Password management software, also known as a password manager, can help you generate and manage strong passwords across multiple sites to make your accounts safer. We recommend the use of a password manager to help keep your online accounts safe.
Monitor the devices that have access to your account
With a Grammarly account, you can receive writing suggestions across different browsers, phones, and computers.
On
Your devices
page, you can check which devices currently have access to your account to make sure no one else is using it. We suggest you periodically check that only devices you are continuing to use have access to your Grammarly account.
If you see any devices that you don’t recognize, please refer to this article:
What should I do if I suspect that my account was hacked?
Set up two-step verification
Two-step verification, sometimes known as two-factor authentication or 2FA, is an additional security measure to help protect your account. If you activate two-step verification, you’ll be asked to provide a six-digit code in addition to your password.
Navigate to the
Two-step verification
page.
Click
Turn On
. You may be asked to verify your account again by entering your password and a 6-digit code sent to your email address.
Select which second factor you would like to use.
If you’d like to use a third-party authenticator app:
Scan the barcode using your preferred third-party authenticator app.
Click
Next
.
Enter the verification code from within your authenticator app.
Click
Verify
to activate two-step verification.
If you’d like to use text messages:
Enter a valid phone number that can receive text messages.
Click
Send Code
.
Enter the verification code you received via text message.
Click
Turn On
to activate two-step verification.
Click
Done
.
Important:
Save the backup codes you’ll receive in the next pop-up in a safe place. If you lose access to your phone or authenticator app, a backup code is the only way you’ll be able to sign in to Grammarly on new devices. You can print them and put them in a safe or store them in a secure file vault.
Be aware of possible phishing attempts
Phishing is an attempt to acquire your personal information by pretending to represent a website or company you trust online.
Phishers will go to great lengths to try to hijack your account or steal your personal information. They may create fake websites that look like Grammarly or send official-looking (but fake) emails asking you for personal information.
Grammarly will never ask for any personal information in an email. This includes:
Payment information (full credit card number, direct debit account, PIN, etc.).
Social security number or tax identification number.
Your account password.
Be careful if you receive an email message asking you for this or any other personal information. If you’re unsure about a link in an email,
you can always hover over the link to see where it goes (you’ll see the real, linked web address at the bottom of most browsers).
Additionally, you should pay close attention to where the email came from. Here’s the full list of domains Grammarly can use to contact you:
@grammarly.com
@bounce.send.grammarly.com
@send.grammarly.com
@security.grammarly.com
@em.grammarly.com
@info.grammarly.com
@mail.grammarly.com
@grammarly.zendesk.com
@notifications.grammarly.com
@notification.grammarly.com
If you’re still not 100% sure that the website you’re on is the real Grammarly site, you can always type
www.grammarly.com
directly into your web browser.
Finally, if you get an email that looks like a phishing attempt, please let us know by forwarding it to support@grammarly.com. Be sure to include the full header of the email. To learn how you can check the full header of an email you received, see this article by Google:
Trace an email with its full header
Keep your devices safe
In order to receive the best possible Grammarly experience, it’s important to keep your devices free of malware and viruses. Signs that your device may be infected include:
Unusually slow or sluggish computer performance.
Pop-up windows or advertisements.
Unexpected reboots, crashes, or freezes.
If you think your device might be infected, you can use the anti-malware, anti-adware, or anti-virus software recommended by your computer manufacturer or a trusted IT professional.
Keep in mind that malware can evolve, and other malicious programs can cause similar problems. Whichever program you choose to use, be sure to keep it updated with the latest software release.
Respond to security-related alerts
If we detect activity on your account, such as a sign-in from a new device, we may notify you of the event via email. If you did not perform the activity, we advise you to immediately follow the instructions in the notification to secure your account, starting with resetting your password. Please note that the location listed in the notification is an approximate location based on the IP address used to access Grammarly, and it may be different from your physical location.
If we detect suspicious activity on your account, we may lock your account and require you to reset your password. This will ensure your account remains secure and only the rightful owner, with access to the registered email address associated with the account, will be able to securely recover it.
Report security flaws to us
If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability on the Grammarly website or app, we strongly encourage you to inform us as quickly as possible by submitting a report to Grammarly on
HackerOne
or by sending an email to security@grammarly.com. We ask that you please contact us prior to disclosing the vulnerability publicly to ensure our users are kept safe.

Your network or system administrator is a person or a provider who administers your local network, your ISP, or your computer settings.
Q: What does Grammarly need in order to function correctly?
A: We use the following endpoints that need to be added to the allowlist for our HTTPS services and for WebSockets:
https:
*.grammarly.com
*.grammarly.io
*.grammarly.net
*.coda.io
WebSockets:
wss://capi.grammarly.com/fpws
wss://capi.grammarly.com/freews
wss://dox.grammarly.com/documents
wss://capi.grammarly.com/wstest
Q: We have ports 80 and 443 opened for any connections, but Grammarly encounters issues with WebSockets. What do we do?
A: In order to work with your firewall correctly, WebSockets not only need these ports to be ""opened"", but there should also be some support on the firewall/proxy level.
After establishing a connection, a browser issues an HTTP request with an Upgrade header, which is a hop-by-hop header, i.e. it is meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and it is neither stored by caches nor forwarded by proxies by default. If a proxy/firewall is not aware of WebSockets and it doesn't forward it further (making some other effort alongside, e.g. keeping the connection active), then it is impossible to establish a connection.
Please consult your proxy/firewall documentation about how to enable support for WebSockets.",[],https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000090311-WebSockets-Support-Q-A-for-System-Administrators,2025-08-11T20:37:26.237680+00:00,1501,False

effd5ae983ad,train,article_0147,AI Chat Support and FAQs,security_config,Privacy and Security,"What is AI Chat?
Grammarly’s AI Chat brings generative AI directly into your workflow - no matter where you’re working. It interacts in a conversational way to answer questions, help with tasks, provide recommendations, create written drafts, and more.
AI Chat can also use context from your active window to make its responses more relevant and personalized. For example, you can ask it to summarize a news article you’re viewing or generate marketing copy based on a campaign brief you have.
Whether you’re looking for quick information, composing a first draft, or just brainstorming, AI Chat adapts to your needs to make your communication and workflow seamless.
AI Chat is currently available as a beta release on macOS.
Which of my data does AI Chat use?
AI Chat uses the text you write when interacting with it. To provide context for your interactions with AI Chat, additional information from the active window is used. Information from the active window includes non-editable text, such as the text of a news article, and the title of the window. You can also add to the context by attaching files while engaging with AI Chat. The text you write and the associated context is sent to Grammarly servers and subsequently third-party LLM providers.
Does AI Chat use information such as my e-mail address, credit card, or phone number?
When you use AI chat, it removes information such as e-mail addresses, credit card, and phone numbers from the text you write as well as the context of your interaction. Specifically, Grammarly servers filter text received from your device before sending it to third-party LLM providers. When you include a file to your interaction with AI Chat it is converted to text so it can be filtered.
Does AI Chat store any data about me?
AI Chat stores a history of your interactions with it, including the text you write, any responses you receive, and the context used.
Where is AI Chat data stored?
When using AI Chat, data is stored on your device and Grammarly servers.
On-device data is stored encrypted at rest using the AES-256 GCM encryption algorithm and a randomly generated 256-bit key. The key is stored protected in Keychain on macOS.
Data stored on Grammarly servers is protected as described in
Technical Specifications
(see “
How We Secure Data
”).
To delete your AI Chat data, including the history of past interactions, right-click on any chat in the lefthand side of the AI Chat window and click “Delete”.
What are some security considerations when using AI Chat?
AI Chat stores a history of your interactions with it on the device where you use it. The data is encrypted and the encryption key is stored in Keychain on macOS. Other people who can log into or unlock the device may be able to access the encryption key from Keychain and subsequently the history of your interactions, which includes text you write, as well as text from windows and files involved in your interactions. We recommend using a hard-to-guess device password and not sharing the password with others. While the device is unlocked, other people may be able to use AI Chat to access the history of your interactions, even if they cannot log into or unlock the device themselves. We recommend logging out of Grammarly before letting others use your device especially if using a shared device such as a school or library computer.

Grammarly is committed to
strong data privacy principles
for all users. Enterprise customers can set additional restrictions on what content or data Grammarly can access.
The client apps controls feature allows Enterprise admins to manage the availability of different Grammarly product offerings for members of their organization’s subscription.
If the availability setting is set to “Managed,” members of the organization’s subscription will not be able to download and install the corresponding Grammarly application independently. In this case, that application can only be installed in a centralized way using a managed software solution or deployment mechanism.
If the availability setting is changed to “Blocked,” the corresponding Grammarly application will not work for the affected members.
The availability settings can be set for the following Grammarly products:
Grammarly Editor
Grammarly for Windows
Grammarly for Mac
Grammarly browser extensions
Grammarly for Mobile

6eaaf08dfe52,train,article_0206,About Grammarly Authorship,feature_info,Generative AI assistance,"What is Grammarly Authorship?
Grammarly Authorship enables users to demonstrate their sources of text in a Google Doc or Microsoft Word document. When a user enables Authorship tracking within either Google Docs (via the Grammarly browser extension) or Microsoft Word (via Grammarly for Windows and Mac),
Grammarly Authorship proactively tracks the writing process. Authorship automatically categorizes the source of text as it is entered into the body of a document. Because Grammarly runs on your browser and across your desktop (via the Mac and Windows client), Grammarly is able to distinguish between text that is typed directly into your document, text that is pasted from a browser-based source, and text that is pasted from an unknown source, like a private browsing window. Furthermore, Grammarly Authorship provides specific categorizations, distinguishing text that is AI-generated from the text that is typed by the end user and then modified with Grammarly’s generative AI rephrasing capability. Authorship also categorizes text that is typed and then edited with traditional, non-generative Grammarly features, like grammatical error correction, clarity rewrites, and word choice suggestions.
As of April 22, 2025, Authorship is available within Google Docs via the Grammarly browser extension and as a beta release in Microsoft Word via Grammarly for Windows and Mac.
For users on accounts obtained or purchased through Grammarly’s website (Free, Pro, and Premium):
Basic Authorship tracking functionality is available to all users in both Google Docs and Microsoft Word, with the option to generate and share any number of Authorship reports. Grammarly Pro and Premium plans also include detailed attribution for external sources other than text entered by the user, including text that is copied from a website or desktop application (in Microsoft Word only) and text that is copied from a generative AI source. If you use Grammarly Pro or Premium, you also have access to AI and plagiarism detection within Authorship reports, showing specific text that may overlap with online sources or may have been AI-generated despite not being directly pasted into the body of the document.
For users on accounts purchased through our Sales team (Grammarly for Education, Enterprise, and certain Pro and Business accounts):
Users on these accounts can also enable tracking, generating, and sharing an unlimited number of reports. Users on these plans will also have detailed attribution from external sources and the ability to see any AI or traditional plagiarism checks within their reports.
Customers who are using the Grammarly browser extension for Chrome and Edge can turn on Authorship within Google Docs. Customers using Grammarly for Windows and Mac can enable Authorship within Microsoft Word on their desktops.
Note for K–12 Grammarly for Education and Grammarly Business account admins:
GB admins can use the admin panel to switch Authorship on or off in the Grammarly browser extension in Google Docs for your entire team.
K-12 institutional admins
should reach out to their Customer Success Manager to request that Authorship be turned on for their users in both Google Docs and Microsoft Word.
By default, Authorship is not available in Grammarly for Windows and Mac for Grammarly Business team members, as it is currently in beta in this product offering. If you’d like your team to have access to Authorship in Microsoft Word before the feature becomes generally available, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager to request it.
How do I activate Grammarly Authorship?
Within Google Docs
If you have the Grammarly browser extension installed in Chrome or Edge and you open a blank Google Doc, you will see a dialog asking you to enable Authorship.
After you click
OK
or close the dialog, you will then see two notifications at the bottom left of your screen: one will let you know that Authorship is now available, and the second one will show the menu to activate Authorship tracking.
You can either:
Click the thumbprint icon next to the
Track writing activity
pop-up to turn on Authorship tracking for that single document session, or
Take no action, in which case nothing is tracked.
You can also select the
Start automatically
option in the widget menu if you want tracking to start automatically whenever a new Google Doc is opened. Doing so means you will always be able to generate a report that categorizes text sources. If you only enable tracking for the current document you are working on, please keep in mind that you will have to turn it on individually from the thumbprint icon at the bottom left for each document you want to track.
Once you click
Track writing activity
(shown as a thumbprint icon) for the first time within Google Docs, a clipboard permissions dialog will show up:
Once you click
Allow access
, your browser extension will ask for its own permissions. The Chrome permissions are shown below, as an example:
IMPORTANT:
Please note that if you do not allow clipboard access, Authorship will only be able to track text actions within the current Google Doc and will
not
be able to attribute any text from browser-based sources.
Once you’ve turned on Authorship and granted clipboard access, the menu will look like the following:
You are always able to keep the thumbprint icon from appearing via the individual settings on the Grammarly browser extension main menu.
Within Microsoft Word
If you have Grammarly for Windows and Mac installed on your computer and you open a blank Microsoft Word document, you will see a dialog asking you to activate Authorship.
After you click
OK
or close the dialog, you will then see two notifications at the bottom left of your screen: one will let you know that Authorship is now available, and the second one will show the menu to activate Authorship tracking.
Note for Mac users:
You must save your document in order to enable tracking.
Once you’ve seen this dialog, you can either:
Click the thumbprint icon next to the
Track writing activity
pop-up to turn on Authorship tracking for the current, single document session, or
Take no action, in which case nothing is tracked.
You can also select the
Start automatically
option in the widget menu if you want tracking to start automatically whenever a new Microsoft Word doc is opened. Doing so means you will always be able to generate a report that categorizes text sources. If you only enable tracking for the current document you are working on, please keep in mind that you will have to turn it on individually from the thumbprint icon at the bottom left of each document you want to track.
Once you click
Track writing activity
(shown as a thumbprint icon) for the first time within Microsoft Word, a clipboard permissions dialog will appear:
IMPORTANT:
Please note that if you do not allow clipboard access, Authorship will only be able to track text actions within the Word doc itself and will
not
be able to attribute any text from browser-based or desktop sources.
Once you have activated Authorship, the following menu will appear on the screen:
You can keep this menu from appearing via the individual settings in Grammarly for Windows and Mac.
How does Grammarly know where my text came from?
Grammarly Authorship only works if you provide access to your clipboard. Once that’s granted via the steps outlined above, Grammarly is able to see the latest text copied to the clipboard from browser-based sites or (if you’re working in Word) from desktop applications. Grammarly only has access to the most recent copied action, as the only thing Grammarly is concerned with is the text that makes its way into the body of the document. With clipboard access, Grammarly can determine whether text is copied from a gen AI source like ChatGPT or Claude, or from a more traditional online source like Wikipedia.
Without clipboard access, Authorship is still able to document your typing actions and actions you take using Grammarly within the document; it can also categorize any pasted text as “copied from an unknown source,” but it will not be able to attribute the text beyond that.
How do I know that Grammarly Authorship is recording my activity in a document?
You are always in control of whether Grammarly Authorship records your writing activity. By default, Grammarly Authorship does not track your writing activity. Once you’ve activated Authorship tracking, you will see the green thumbprint icon in the lower-left corner of the screen in both Google Docs and Microsoft Word. The thumbprint icon will be gray if tracking is not activated.
How do I view my Authorship report?
When you are ready to view your report, hover over or click the thumbprint icon at the bottom left of your screen and click
See report
. In both Microsoft Word and Google Docs, the report will open in a separate tab within your default browser. The report will have three sets of information available to you, and whichever audience you decide to share it with:
Authorship Analytics
—Shows a breakdown of your text sources, organized by “human-typed” and “sourced” categories, along with data about the amount of time spent on the document and the number of active writing sessions. A “session” expires after 10 minutes of idle time in the document.
Authorship Report
—The report includes the full body of your text, color-coded by text category, along with details about the text source.
Authorship Replay
—The replay shows your full typing and editing history from start to finish. Particularly if you wrote over a long period of time, the replay is meant to help you remember the primary actions you took in your document, giving you the opportunity to delete any unnecessary text, cite sources accordingly, and make any last-minute edits.
Grammarly Authorship is showing inconsistent attribution. Why is that?
While Authorship is now generally available in Google Docs, it’s not necessarily able to capture 100% of cases accurately. There may be cases where keystrokes are typed too fast for Authorship to pick them up accurately, cases where text is pasted from a desktop source where Authorship does not run, or instances where text was pasted from a new AI tool that has yet to be categorized as generative AI. Authorship is still a beta feature within Microsoft Word, which means text attribution may be more unstable than in Google Docs.
If you notice a bug in either platform, please report it by contacting our Support team here:
Submit a request
.
How do I share my report with others?
At the top of your report, you’ll see a green
Share
button. Upon clicking it, you’ll see a unique URL that you can copy and share with whoever you choose. Your audience will be able to see all of the same information you see in the report.
What content is attributed and what is not?
Within Google Docs:
Any text from a browser-based source where Grammarly is available will be attributed. That means text from a generative AI tool, academic article, periodical, and more will be attributed. Text that is copied from a desktop source or private browsing window will not be attributed, but will be categorized as “Copied from an unknown source.”
Within Microsoft Word:
Similar to Google Docs, any text from a browser-based source where Grammarly is available will be attributed. Additionally, because the Grammarly desktop application works across desktop apps, text from other desktop applications will also be attributed (examples are Notes and the ChatGPT desktop app).
Which Authorship features are available on the Grammarly Free plan? Which are available on Grammarly Pro, Premium, Enterprise, Grammarly for Education, and Grammarly Business plans?
All Grammarly users have access to Authorship’s basic tracking and reporting features.

What data does Grammarly Authorship collect about me?
To provide a record of your editing history, Grammarly Authorship will collect the text you write in the context of a document, including text you write and then delete, text you paste from websites or desktop sources and their source names such as Wikipedia and ChatGPT, as well as your prompts to generative AI.
We encourage you to review with our
Privacy Policy
and
Data Privacy Addendum
. You can also
submit a request in the account hub
anytime to view data associated with your account.
What data does Grammarly Authorship NOT collect about me?
Grammarly does
not
collect or store any data that is not pertinent to the writing process. In other words, Grammarly does not track browsing history or web traffic that does not involve copying text into your clipboard (for instance, video views, article reading, gaming activity, etc.). Grammarly is merely collecting the text that you copy into your browser’s clipboard and then paste into the body of your Google Doc.
Where is Grammarly Authorship data stored?
While you are writing, Grammarly Authorship stores its data on your device only.
On-device data is stored encrypted at rest using the AES-256 GCM encryption algorithm and a randomly generated 256-bit key. The key is stored on Grammarly servers, retrieved from your device on demand during your Grammarly session, and stored in memory for the purpose of reading and writing encrypted authorship data. When you delete your browsing data related to Google Docs, the Authorship on-device data is deleted as well.
When you click the “See report” button on the thumbprint icon at the bottom left of the screen, Authorship data for the current document is sent to Grammarly servers, over an encrypted connection using TLS, for processing. The data remains on Grammarly servers for up to 24 hours.
When you share your Grammarly Authorship report with others, such as an instructor or editor, the report data for the respective document is sent to Grammarly servers and stored for 12 months or until you delete your account, whichever comes first. As the originating user, you can view the report anytime during that 12-month period by going back to the original document and clicking
View report
. You can also delete this report data at any time by clicking on the trash bin icon for the respective document, as shown below.
What Authorship data is shared when I generate and send a report link?
When sharing a report, your reader has the ability to see all the same information you do when you view the Authorship report, including:
Top-level document analytics
The full text of your document, color-coded by source
Text insight cards that describe the text source, word counts, words edited, and typing/editing time
A full replay of your typing and editing process
The replay feature includes the ability to see text being written and deleted, the names of websites where text is copied from, and your prompts to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. You can preview what data will be available to your instructor by choosing “See report” and replaying the writing activity before sharing it. You also have the option of excluding the replay in the report when sharing, if you do not want your audience to see your entire writing and editing process.
What are some security considerations when using Grammarly Authorship?
Grammarly Authorship data includes a history of how your document has been edited, including parts of the document you have deleted from its latest version, as well as the names of websites you may have used while editing your document. While this data is encrypted on-device at rest, it may be accessible by other users of the device while you are logged in to your Grammarly account on that device. We recommend logging out of Grammarly before letting others use your device, especially if you are using a shared device such as a school or library computer.
For Grammarly for Education Admins: Authorship Analytics
As your users activate and use Authorship, you will begin to see aggregated data in your Grammarly for Education admin panel under the
Analytics
tab. The
Authorship Analytics
subtab will show the following data across your institution as Authorship is used:
Total amount of text that is typed
Total amount of text that is copied from a website
Total amount of text that is AI-generated
The top 10 sources of external text used in writing
Note:
In the spring of 2025, only data from Google Docs will be populated in the dashboard.

These are sometimes referred to as agents, launch agents, daemons, services, or login items. Below is a list of their purpose, when they run, and related files.
Grammarly Desktop Helper
Purpose
This helper ensures the stability and performance of the main application by restarting it in the event of a crash or hang. Additionally, it acts as an intermediary in the communication with browsers to integrate with certain websites.
Lifecycle
The system service launchd starts this process at login, and restarts it if it gets terminated. This is achieved by using the KeepAlive and RunAtLoad options.
Files
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.grammarly.ProjectLlama.Shepherd.plist
/Applications/Grammarly Desktop.app/Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/Grammarly Desktop Helper.app
Grammarly Desktop Update Service
Purpose
The update service is a secondary update mechanism for the main Grammarly app. It periodically checks for updates released by the Grammarly team in case the primary update mechanism built into the main app fails.
Lifecycle
The system service launchd starts this process on startup, and restarts it if it gets terminated. This is achieved by using the KeepAlive and RunAtLoad options. If the service cannot be started by launchd, the main Grammarly app will also launch this process as a regular process (not an agent).
Files
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.grammarly.ProjectLlama.UpdateService.plist
~/Library/Application Support/com.grammarly.ProjectLlama/Grammarly Desktop Update Service.app
/Applications/Grammarly Desktop.app/Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/Grammarly Desktop Update Service.app
Grammarly Desktop Uninstaller
Purpose
This process detects when the main Grammarly application has been deleted and performs cleanup tasks, such as removing other background processes and their associated files.
Lifecycle
The system service launchd starts this process when files are changed in the /Applications directory. The process immediately terminates after checking whether Grammarly has been uninstalled and performing the necessary cleanup actions. This is achieved by using the WatchPaths option.

How do I install the plugin?
To add the Grammarly plugin for Figma, visit this page:
Grammarly plugin
.
Where does the plugin work?
The plugin works in both the desktop and web versions of Figma and FigJam on Windows and Mac.
To use the plugin, you need to have Grammarly for Windows or Grammarly for Mac installed and running. When you run the Grammarly Figma plugin, you will see suggestions as soon as you select a text layer.
The plugin supports any text layer, including stickies, shapes, and tables in FigJam.
Note:
The plugin doesn't check the text in comments in Figma or FigJam.
What features are available?
All features that are currently offered in Grammarly for Windows and Mac are available in this plugin.
How do I use the plugin?
Once you run the Grammarly plugin for Figma, you will see a window prompting you to select at least one text layer to view suggestions from Grammarly.
When a text layer is selected, the Grammarly Figma plugin will show a window with the text from the text layer.
Note:
The text shown in the plugin window will not display the formatting. The formatting will be applied automatically once you click
Update text layer.
If the selected text layer has multiple styles and formatting, the Grammarly Figma plugin will insert the text according to the style or formatting of the first word of the text.
You can view, accept, and dismiss suggestions inline and via the assistant mode. The changes you make at this point are applied to the text in the plugin window.
Once you've responded to the suggestions, click
Update text layer.
The final text will be inserted into the corresponding text layer in Figma or FigJam.",[],https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/24089819317389-Introducing-Grammarly-s-plugin-for-Figma-and-FigJam,2025-08-11T20:38:00.351194+00:00,1746,False

When this setting is activated, company employees won’t be able to use their personal Grammarly accounts at work.
Managed Mode will also deactivate the clients and stop sending text to our servers if:
The user is not logged in
The user is logged in but is not part of the relevant organization
Note:
Users will still be able to log in with personal accounts through our sign-in page; however, they won’t be able to use the clients.
Activating Managed Mode
Prerequisite:
SSO needs to be activated for your organization, and you will also need a Grammarly Enrollment Token. To obtain a Grammarly Enrollment Token, please go to the
Managed Mode
page in your account, or contact your Customer Success Manager. Alternatively, please contact the
Grammarly Support team
.
Grammarly for Windows
The following key and string value need to be configured in the registry:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Grammarly\DesktopIntegrations]
""GrammarlyEnrollmentToken""=""UUID""
where UUID is your Grammarly Enrollment Token with value type “REG_SZ”.
This change will switch Grammarly for Windows to Managed Mode; the Grammarly for Windows floating button will become gray, and the mode will prevent Grammarly for Windows from checking text until users sign in with the accounts provided by the organization.
Grammarly for Mac
If using JAMF or a similar tool, you can deploy a custom configuration profile (
see instructions
) with the following Preference domain: com.grammarly.ProjectLlama
The configuration profile template:
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"">
<plist version=""1.0"">
<dict>
<key>GrammarlyEnrollmentToken</key>
<string>UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
where UUID is your Grammarly Enrollment Token.
This change will switch Grammarly for Mac to Managed Mode; the Grammarly for Mac floating button will become gray, and the mode will prevent Grammarly for Mac from checking text until users sign in with the accounts provided by the organization.
Grammarly for Chrome (Windows)
The following key needs to be configured in the Windows Registry:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\3rdparty\extensions\kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen\policy]
The string value should include the following value:
""GrammarlyEnrollmentToken""=""UUID""
Note:
kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen
is the ID of the official Grammarly for Chrome extension, and UUID should be replaced with your Grammarly Enrollment Token with value type “REG_SZ”.
Grammarly for Chrome will switch to Managed Mode when it discovers a valid enrollment token and obtains the settings for your organization from our servers.
Once this is configured, here is what will change:
Instead of a regular “Sign in” button, it will show a “Sign in with SSO” button that leads directly to the IdP URL.
After login, it will display the “Managed by ...” label at the bottom of the extension’s pop-up dialog (the one that you see when clicking the G icon in Chrome’s extensions bar). Hovering over the company name would also display the enrollment token that it read from the settings.
Note:
Make sure to restart the Chrome browser after modifying the registry for this change to take effect. For Windows 11, you will need to reboot or reload policies by accessing chrome://policy/ in Chrome.
Grammarly for Chrome (Mac)
This can be done by creating a .plist file in the /Library/Managed Preferences/{username} folder.
File name:
com.google.Chrome.extensions.kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen.plist
File contents:
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"">
<plist version=""1.0"">
<dict>
<key>GrammarlyEnrollmentToken</key>
<string>UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
Note:
Make sure to replace UUID with your Grammarly Enrollment Token.
Finally, convert the XML file to binary using the following terminal command:
plutil -convert binary1 {filename} com.google.Chrome.extensions.kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen
If using JAMF or a similar tool, you can deploy a custom configuration profile (
see instructions
) with the following Preference domain:
com.google.Chrome.extensions.kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen
You can then upload a .plist file with the file contents shown above. The file should be in XML format.
Grammarly for Chrome (Chromebooks)
In the Google Admin panel, go to
Apps & Extensions
.
Navigate to the
Users & browsers
tab and click on
Grammarly
to open additional settings.
Find
Policy for extensions
and paste the following text, where UUID is your Grammarly Enrollment Token:
{""GrammarlyEnrollmentToken"":{""Value"":""UUID""}}
Then, save the changes.
Note:
Your UUID can be found on your
Managed Mode
page when you unfold the
Show configuration details
section
.
Grammarly for Edge (Windows)
The following key needs to be configured in the Windows Registry:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\3rdparty\extensions\cnlefmmeadmemmdciolhbnfeacpdfbkd\policy]
The string value should include the following value:
""GrammarlyEnrollmentToken""=""UUID""
Note:
cnlefmmeadmemmdciolhbnfeacpdfbkd is the ID of the official Grammarly for Edge extension, and UUID should be replaced with your Grammarly Enrollment Token with value type “REG_SZ”.
Grammarly for Edge will switch to Managed Mode when it discovers a valid enrollment token and obtains the settings for your organization from our servers.
Note:
Make sure to restart the Edge browser after modifying the registry for this change to take effect.
Grammarly for Edge (Mac)
This can be done by creating a .plist file in the /Library/Managed Preferences/username folder.
File name:
com.microsoft.Edge.extensions.cnlefmmeadmemmdciolhbnfeacpdfbkd.plist
File contents:
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"">
<plist version=""1.0"">
<dict>
<key>GrammarlyEnrollmentToken</key>
<string>UUID</string>
</dict>
</plist>
Note:
Make sure to replace the UUID with your Grammarly Enrollment Token.
The last step is to deploy your .plist file to your users’ Mac devices using your preferred MDM provider, such as Microsoft Intune. For instructions, see
Deploy your plist
.
For Jamf, upload the .plist file as a Custom Settings payload.
Grammarly for Firefox (Windows)
This can be done by creating a JSON file following the Firefox
Managed storage manifests instructions
.
Under the data section, add “GrammarlyEnrollmentToken”=“UUID”, where UUID is your Grammarly Enrollment Token.

""type"": ""storage"",
""data"":
{
""GrammarlyEnrollmentToken"": ""UUID""
}
}
Save and put this file in any location on the computer.
Create a registry key with the following name:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\ManagedStorage\name]
where
name
equals the
name
value from the file. The key should have a single default value, which is the path to the file.
Note:
Make sure to restart the Firefox browser after modifying the registry for this change to take effect.
Grammarly for Firefox (Mac)
This can be done by creating a JSON file following the Firefox
Managed storage manifests instructions
.
Under the data section, add the “GrammarlyEnrollmentToken”=“UUID”, where UUID is your Grammarly Enrollment Token
Under the name section, add the Firefox extension ID: 87677a2c52b84ad3a151a4a72f5bd3c4@jetpack

""description"": ""ignored"",
""type"": ""storage"",
""data"":
{
""GrammarlyEnrollmentToken"":""UUID""
}
}
For global visibility, save and put this file in:

For per-user visibility, save and put this file in:
~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/ManagedStorage/<name>.json
Note:
Make sure to restart the Firefox browser after modifying the registry for this change to take effect.

Managed by:
Admins, account managers, group managers, and members with custom roles
Members of team plans can be assigned one of three roles: admin, account manager, or user.
In Grammarly Enterprise plans, members with the user role can also be granted group manager permissions or assigned a custom role.
Roles
User
The
user role
grants access to Grammarly’s full range of writing suggestions and limited view-only access to account analytics. This role is assigned by default to new members who join a team’s plan.
User role with group manager permissions
The user role with group manager permissions is designed for team members who need to manage and maintain aspects of their specific team’s product usage. This includes viewing analytics as well as managing style rules and other writing configurations for their team. Team members with group manager permissions can manage the settings only for the teams they are specifically assigned to as group managers. User role with group manager permissions might be suitable for managers or team leaders. You can grant group manager permissions to multiple team members with the user role.
Note:
Group manager permissions are available only to Grammarly Enterprise customers. To learn more, please see this article:
Group manager permissions for team members
Account manager
The account manager role is designed for team members who want to manage and maintain aspects of their organization’s plan related to product usage. This includes viewing analytics as well as managing style guides and other writing configurations for multiple teams or across the whole organization. Team members with the account manager role might be department heads or managers. You can assign the account manager role to multiple team members.
Admin
The
admin role
is designed for team members who need full control over all aspects of the team’s plan. Admins have access to everything available under the account manager or group manager roles, plus they can manage IT configurations (including single sign-on) and subscription details for billing purposes. Team members with the admin role might be founders and executives, senior leadership, or someone from the IT department who provisions licenses or handles account administration. You can assign the admin role to multiple team members.
Custom role
Additionally, Grammarly Enterprise customers can create custom roles. Unlike predefined default roles, which come with a fixed set of permissions, custom roles allow enterprise admins to mix and match permissions to create roles that suit their organization’s unique needs.

Topics covered in this article:
What’s included in the voice features?

What’s included in the voice features?
Here’s what the voice features include:
automatic detection of a user’s writing style
voice profile that displays the user’s writing style:
generative AI prompt that applies the user’s writing style to their text
Personalized voice profile
You can view your personalized voice profile by clicking the lightbulb icon and selecting the
voice icon
in the upper-right corner:
Grammarly detects your unique voice profile from your writing and updates the profile continuously as you write.
Additionally, Grammarly understands that you may write short messages in one style and use a different style for longer documents. So it keeps separate voice profiles for documents and messages and can apply the appropriate profile based on the application or website you’re using.
You can switch between the
Documents
and
Messages
tabs to view the corresponding voice profile:
Also, you can customize your voice profile by selecting your role and dialect. To do so, open your voice profile and hover over the section that contains your name, role, and dialect to reveal the
Edit
button:
You can also remove the communication style elements from your voice profile by clicking on them and selecting
No, remove it
:
How to use the voice features
Once Grammarly has created your voice profile, you can apply it to your text using on-demand generative AI assistance. Here’s how:
Highlight the text you’d like to rewrite in your voice and click the lightbulb icon or the pencil icon that appears.
In the pop-up that appears next, select
Rewrite in my voice
. You may need to click
More
to see this option.
You can instantly insert the rewritten text into your writing or continue editing it by clicking

If you use the Grammarly Keyboard on your iPad, you can customize your writing experience. To see the list of settings you can adjust, open the Grammarly app and tap
Keyboard
at the bottom of the screen:
Here you can adjust the following preferences:
Keyboard Layout
Grammarly for iPad's ""Keyboard Layout"" feature allows you to customize your keyboard layout according to your preference. It offers a variety of layout options, including QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, and Workman. You can also easily switch between these layouts. This feature is especially useful for those who are familiar with different keyboard layouts or who want to try out new layouts to improve their typing speed and accuracy.
Emoji Suggestions
With this feature, you can easily find and use the perfect emoji to enhance your written communication. As you type, Grammarly suggests relevant emoji based on the words you are using, making it easy to add a bit of fun and personality to any message. Whether you're chatting with friends or sending a professional email, emoji suggestions can help you express yourself in a more engaging and effective way.
Emoji Key
The Emoji Key provides quick and convenient access to a wide range of expressive emoji. When this option is turned on, the Emoji Key appears next to the 123 key on your iPad keyboard. With a simple tap, you can access a diverse collection of emoji to add personality, emotion, and visual flair to your messages.
Synonyms
The Synonyms feature in Grammarly for iPad enriches your writing by providing a quick and convenient way to explore alternative word choices. When this feature is turned on, you can easily access synonyms by placing the cursor next to a word. The synonyms will appear on the top bar of the Grammarly Keyboard.
Swipe Typing
The Swipe Typing feature in Grammarly for iPad revolutionizes your typing experience by enabling faster and more intuitive text input. With this feature, you can effortlessly compose messages, emails, and documents by gliding your finger across the keyboard instead of tapping individual keys.
It is only possible to trigger swipe typing on an iPad in floating mode
—
when the keyboard is the size of the iPhone keyboard.
To change to the floating keyboard on an iPad, follow these steps:
Open any app that requires text input, such as Messages or Notes.
Tap on the text field to bring up the onscreen keyboard.
Touch and hold the keyboard icon (located in the lower-right corner of the keyboard) until a menu appears.
From the menu, select ""Floating"" or ""Undock"" (the exact wording may vary depending on your iPad model and iOS version).
The keyboard will now detach from the bottom of the screen and become a smaller, movable window.
You can move the floating keyboard around the screen by dragging it with your finger.
To dock the keyboard back to the bottom of the screen, touch and hold the keyboard icon again and select ""Dock"" or ""Merge"" from the menu.
Note:
Not all iPad models and iOS versions support the floating keyboard feature. If you don't see the option to switch to the floating keyboard, it may not be available on your device.
Delete Swipe by Word
The Delete Swipe by Word feature in Grammarly for iPad simplifies the process of deleting text by allowing you to delete entire words with a single swipe. With this feature activated, you can effortlessly remove words or phrases by touching your finger to the Backspace key (the key to the right of ""m"") and immediately sliding it to the left. The farther you slide it, the more words will be selected and deleted. Instead of tediously deleting one character at a time, Grammarly intelligently recognizes your swipe gesture and instantly erases entire words, saving you time and effort.
Completions Bar
The Completions Bar feature in Grammarly for iPad enhances your writing efficiency by providing intelligent word suggestions as you type. Located above the keyboard, the Completions Bar dynamically displays relevant word options based on the context of your text. As you type, Grammarly analyzes your input and offers predictive suggestions to help you complete your sentences with accuracy and speed. Simply select a suggested word from the Completions Bar to insert it into your text.
Auto-Capitalization
Grammarly intuitively recognizes the beginning of sentences, proper nouns, and other instances where capitalization is required. As you type, Grammarly takes care of capitalizing the first letter of each sentence and appropriate names, saving you the effort of manually correcting capitalization errors.
Enable Caps Lock
By enabling this feature, you can turn on the Caps Lock mode within your keyboard, allowing you to type in uppercase without having to hold the shift key continuously. This is especially useful when you need to emphasize a word, write acronyms, or enter text in all caps.
Note:
To activate Caps Lock, double-tap the shift/up arrow key.
Auto-Correction
The Auto-Correction feature in Grammarly for iPad ensures that your writing is free from spelling mistakes and typos by automatically applying common corrections as you type.
Sound Feedback on Keypress
With this feature enabled, Grammarly generates a subtle sound effect when you press each key on the keyboard.
Show Lowercase Keys
When enabled, this option ensures that the keyboard always shows the lowercase letters, regardless of the capitalization state. This helps you maintain a consistent visual reference of the lowercase alphabet, making it easier to recognize and select the appropriate keys while typing.
“.” Shortcut
Double-tapping the spacebar will insert a period followed by a space.
To turn any of these options on or off, switch the toggle next to them.

Additionally, faculty can view Grammarly’s writing score for each submission, which offers an initial insight into the work’s readability.
The goal of this integration is for students to submit higher-quality written work, enabling faculty to review assignments more efficiently and pay closer attention to the substance of the writing rather than to its readability.

rubric, course details, writing topic, and any publicly available information about your instructor. This gives you a customized set of recommendations at both the document and paragraph level, as well as an estimated grade to help you improve and get the grade you really want.
The AI Grader agent is available in

FAQs
Is using the AI Grader agent considered cheating?
The AI Grader agent is designed to help you improve your writing to meet your assignment requirements. It aims to coach you on how to make your work better. This shouldn’t be regarded as cheating, but if you’re in doubt, ask your instructor. While the grade is a prediction, it should not be considered the final grade you will receive after submitting.
What kinds of assignments can the AI Grader agent evaluate?
The AI Grader can assess any kind of writing assignment across disciplines. The more specific the criteria you provide, the more specific and targeted its feedback will be.
Can the AI Grader agent detect plagiarism?
No. To check your text for plagiarism, you need to use the Plagiarism Checker agent.
Will my school or professor find out I used the AI Grader agent?
The AI Grader agent is designed to help students double-check and improve their work before submission. It does not include features for instructors. Remember that the rewrite components of the AI Grader agent are AI-based. We recommend consulting your instructor before using any generative AI features in tools like Grammarly to ensure you're following the proper policies.
How does the AI Grader know what my professor might think of my paper?
AI Grader is not a “replica” of your professor. If you provide your rubric and professor information, AI Grader will cross-reference publicly available information on the web to gauge how your professor might evaluate the line of thinking in your paper.

Grammarly Premium users will gradually be transferred to Grammarly Pro plans throughout this year. Your billing amount will remain the same. For more information, please review this article:
Updating the Grammarly Premium plan to the Grammarly Pro plan
Who can I invite to my Grammarly Pro team?
You can invite Grammarly Free, Grammarly Premium, and other Grammarly Pro users to your Grammarly Pro team. Grammarly Business and Grammarly for Education users cannot be invited to a Grammarly Pro team at this time.
How do I invite members to my Grammarly Pro team?
To invite team members, please follow these steps:
Go to the
Members
page and click
Invite members
in the upper-right corner.
Next, enter your team members’ email addresses and click
Invite members
.
To join your subscription, invited team members need to click the link in the invitation sent to their email addresses.
Note:
Additional seats for invited members are billed separately according to the standard subscription rates. The charge amount for additional seats is prorated based on the remaining days in your current subscription period. In the next billing cycle, you will be charged the full amount for the updated number of seats on your subscription renewal date.
Can I remove my team members?
As a Grammarly Pro admin, you can remove members of your team at any time. If your team member had a Grammarly Free account before joining your Grammarly Pro team, they will revert to Grammarly Free. If they had a Grammarly Pro subscription, they will be able to continue using it after you remove them from your Grammarly Pro team.
Note:
Members with the admin role should be unassigned this role before they can be removed.
Can my team members leave my Grammarly Pro team on their own?
Grammarly Pro members can leave their team’s subscription on their own unless they are assigned the admin role. Grammarly Pro admins can leave only after their admin role is unassigned.
What happens with my current subscription if I join a Grammarly Pro team?
If you have a Grammarly Premium subscription, you will automatically receive a prorated refund for the unused period. It may take up to 10 business days for the refund to appear on your statement, depending on your payment method.
If you have a Grammarly Pro subscription, depending on whether you are the sole member of your Grammarly Pro team, either your subscription will be paused once you join another Grammarly Pro team, or you will be removed from your current team and added to the new team. If you are a Grammarly Pro admin, you will need to transfer the admin role to another team member before joining a different team.
You can also request a refund for your original Grammarly Pro subscription after joining another Grammarly Pro team. To do that, go to the
Subscription
page and click
Request a Refund

If you choose not to request a refund for your previous subscription, it will remain paused. If you leave your current Grammarly Pro team, your previous subscription will resume immediately, and you will keep access to advanced features for the remaining subscription period.
Can I expand my Grammarly Pro team after the original purchase?
You can add more seats to your Grammarly Pro plan at any time. You will be charged a prorated amount for every new team member you invite to join your account.

and write on!
Many Grammarly users spend more time writing online than they may realize. Think about it. Between emails, blog posts, and status updates, our users are writing the equivalent of a novel each month, on average. That’s a lot of words! But what does that mean for you?
Well, read on to find out.
This progress report is an analysis of your writing with Grammarly and provides insights that may help you to become an even better writer. Your progress report looks at three main components of your writing: productivity, mastery, and vocabulary.
PRODUCTIVITY
Productivity measures your total word count for the week and also shows how you compare to other Grammarly users. You can also see how the current week compares to your last four weeks of activity. Hey, all those status updates and emails really start to add up!
MASTERY
Mastery analyzes how many (or how few) mistakes you corrected with Grammarly as it relates to total words written. The fewer mistakes you need to correct with Grammarly, the more accurately you write. You can also see how well you did compared to other Grammarly users and track your progress over the past month.
VOCABULARY
The Vocabulary section will show you how many unique words you’ve written throughout the prior week. The percentage shown lets you know how dynamic — meaning, how varied and diverse — your vocabulary is relative to Grammarly users.
TONE
The Tone section shows the tones found in your writing during the previous week.
TOTAL WORDS ANALYZED
This section reflects the total number of words that Grammarly has analyzed since your account was created.

Ensuring the safety and security of our users' information is important to us at Grammarly. We
maintain protections
and practice
privacy by design
.
What data does Grammarly collect?
To serve our users, Grammarly collects necessary information, such as username, email address, and contact and language preferences. Read more in our
Privacy Policy
. Any user can
submit a request in the account hub
to view data associated with their account. You can also find information about the trusted
processors
and service providers that help us provide our services.
Does Grammarly train its models with my data?
All users have access to our
Product Improvement and Training control
, which gives them the ability to opt out of allowing Grammarly to use their content to improve its products or train its models. We do not train on any content from certain business users or users whose accounts originate in the EU or UK, automatically. Further, individual users can
control where Grammarly operates
—for instance, in a browser, and on the desktop—which affects how much of your data it processes.
How is this data sent, processed, and stored?
All data is transferred to the United States for processing and storage using Amazon Web Services, one of the world’s leading data center providers.
Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2.
Data at rest is encrypted using AES256.
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
Grammarly implements technical controls to isolate each customer’s data. Customer data is stored in a multi-tenant environment but is segregated logically via tenant IDs. Any writing that an individual or organization reviews with Grammarly will never appear in another customer’s writing suggestions.
What data does Grammarly store?
We will store documents created in the Grammarly Editor until they are deleted by the user or upon request after contract termination or expiration.
For all other user text processed by Grammarly (i.e., anything not saved in the Grammarly Editor), a customer’s personal data is used only as necessary to deliver and administer services to that same customer and is always used in a fair, transparent manner in accordance with the customer’s privacy expectations.
To provide a seamless and highly functional experience, we may leverage random samples of aggregated and de-identified user content to refine and enhance our service for all customers unless the user has opted out of having their content used for
product improvement and training
.
How can I delete the personal data Grammarly stores about me?
In accordance with our Privacy Policy, you can delete your personal data from Grammarly by deleting your account. This will include any user documents that you stored in the Grammarly Editor. The instructions on how to do that are available on the
Delete your Grammarly account
page.
Additionally, you are able to see data that Grammarly associates with your account by requesting a personal data report. Request a personal data report by navigating to your
privacy settings
and clicking “Submit Request” under Personal Data Report.
Do you share my content with anyone?
We take your privacy very seriously. We do not share your content with any third parties except for the generative AI partners described below, and only then with security and sanitization measures in place. We have security measures in place to ensure that your content stays private so you can trust that it is safe with us.
Any information used to power Grammarly’s generative AI features, such as prompt type, prompt text, and the context in which it’s used, will be shared with our small number of thoroughly vetted partners for the sole purpose of providing you with the Grammarly experience. We do not allow these partners or any third parties to use your content for training their models or improving their products. You can
find information here
about the trusted processors and service providers that help us provide our services. See our
Privacy Policy
to learn more.
Grammarly maintains a thorough vendor-review process to conduct due diligence before engaging with any processors.
Can someone at Grammarly access my data?
No one individual at Grammarly can read your text at will. We tightly control access to user data within the company. Only those with an approved need to access certain data are granted access via specific, audited permissions. Access to data requires review and approval by responsible managers and a member of the security team.
Do you sell my content?
No, we do not and will not sell the content you upload to our products, and we do not make money by selling your user content. We offer a free product and hope you’ll purchase our paid product. We make money when users purchase our paid products.
Is Grammarly a keylogger?
No. A keylogger is a type of malicious software or surveillance tool that records every keystroke typed on a keyboard without the user’s knowledge. The captured data—such as passwords or personal information—is often sent to a third party for purposes like identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access. Grammarly’s product doesn’t fit any of these descriptions. At Grammarly, we value user trust and operate with high standards for privacy and transparency. You can feel confident using Grammarly’s product offerings knowing that: Grammarly is blocked from running in read-only and sensitive fields, such as payment forms, passwords, addresses, and URLs. We make it clear when Grammarly is active by turning the G button green. You can easily turn it off any time, then turn it back on within a document or site using the easy-to-find floating G icon when you use Grammarly for Windows or Mac; or an on/off toggle when you use Grammarly Extension, which you can find by pressing on the Grammarly icon located on the top bar of your web browser.

What is the Product Improvement and Training control?
The Product Improvement and Training control allows users of Grammarly Free, Premium, and single-user Pro accounts to opt out of allowing Grammarly to use their content to train its models and improve its product for everyone. Product improvements include training and validating Grammarly’s AI and machine learning models and general research that informs Grammarly feature development and enhancement. Product Improvement and Training is on for individual users by default.
We do not train on any content from users whose account originates in the EU, UK, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland. This is reflected in the privacy settings of those users.
How do I turn Product Improvement and Training on or off?
Follow the steps below to turn on or off Product Improvement and Training:
For Grammarly Free and Premium Accounts:
Go to your account’s privacy settings at
account.grammarly.com/security/privacy
.
Click the “Product Improvement and Training” toggle to change its setting.

Other FAQs
1. What does “product improvement and training” mean?
Generative AI relies on large language models (LLMs), and LLMs are taught using large datasets. In some cases, that includes customer data. This is what we mean by the term “training.” In addition, Grammarly is able to process customer data to learn how our product is used and how it might function better. This is what “product improvement” means. In sum, product improvement and training refer to:
Training datasets for AI and ML
Validation of models
General research that informs what features Grammarly could build or enhance
With product improvement and training turned off, Grammarly will not process user content for the above purposes.
2. What content is impacted by the Product Improvement and Training control?
When this control is turned off, none of the content a user inputs into an application or website that Grammarly runs on will be used for training and product improvement for everyone who uses Grammarly. Grammarly may still collect non-content data, such as writing statistics (total words written, types of suggestions accepted, mistakes made, etc.), and may use that data for product improvement and training.
3. How do you protect my content and data?
We take robust steps to protect all of our users and their data, with industry-leading security, privacy, and responsible AI measures. If a user allows Grammarly to use their content for product improvement and training, all sampled content is de-identified (removing any association to the identity of a user), sanitized (removing sensitive data such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or email addresses), and other identifiable content is replaced with random values—for example, the name “Christopher Pike” is replaced with “John Doe.”
4. Does my Product Improvement and Training setting change if I join a Grammarly Business or Education account?
If a Free or Premium user joins an institution account, they will automatically adopt the Product Improvement and Training setting status set by the organization’s admin. However, EU, UK, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland users are not affected by their admin’s setting; training will remain off.
5. Does my Product Improvement and Training setting change if I create a Grammarly Business or Education account?
If a Free or Premium user creates a Team, Pro, or Enterprise account (meaning they become the first admin), the Product Improvement and Training setting for the institution will start with the default setting for that type of institution.
For all Grammarly Education accounts, and for Team, Pro, and Enterprise accounts purchased through the Grammarly Sales team, Product Improvement and Training is automatically off, meaning we will not use content from any users within that organization to train our models.
For Grammarly Team or Pro accounts purchased directly through the Grammarly website, Product Improvement and Training will initially be on, and an admin can opt out for their entire organization.
6. How does my Product Improvement and Training setting change if I leave a Grammarly Business or Education account, becoming a Free user?
If a user leaves a Grammarly Team, Pro, Enterprise, or Education account and becomes a Free user, the Product Improvement and Training control will keep the setting it had when they were a member of the Business or Education account. The Product Improvement and Training toggle will be visible to the user and modifiable if they wish to change that setting.
Users in the EU, UK, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland will never see the Product Improvement and Training control because it always remains off.

What is the Product Improvement and Training control?
The Product Improvement and Training control allows administrators of Grammarly Business accounts and of multiuser Pro accounts purchased through our website to opt out of allowing Grammarly to use their organization's content to train its models and improve its product for other users. Product improvements include training and validating Grammarly’s AI and machine learning models and general research that informs Grammarly feature development and enhancement.
See below for how an administrator can turn on and off organization content being used for product improvement and training.
We do not train on any organization content from users whose account originates in the EU, UK, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland, regardless of the setting of this control.
How do I turn Product Improvement and Training on or off?
Follow the steps below to turn on or off Product Improvement and Training:
Go to your account’s data settings at
https://account.grammarly.com/admin/data_settings
.
Click the “Product Improvement and Training” toggle to change its setting.
Only administrators can change the Product Improvement and Training setting for multiuser accounts.
Important Note:
The default setting is on (green checkmark shown), meaning that Product Improvement & Training is enabled. Clicking the toggle will turn it off, meaning that Grammarly will not use your content for training.
Other FAQs
1. What does “product improvement and training” mean?
Generative AI relies on large language models (LLMs), and LLMs are “taught” using large datasets. In some cases, that includes customer data. This is what we mean by the term “training.” In addition, Grammarly is able to process customer data to learn how our product is used and how it might function better. This is what “product improvement” means. In sum, product improvement and training refer to:
Training datasets for AI and ML
Validation of models
General research that informs what features Grammarly could build or enhance
With product improvement and training off, Grammarly will not use your organization's content for the above purposes.
2. What data is impacted by the Product Improvement and Training control?
When this control is turned off, none of the content a user inputs into an application or website that Grammarly runs on will be used for training and product improvement for other Grammarly users. Grammarly may still collect non-content data, such as writing statistics (total words written, types of suggestions accepted, mistakes made, etc.), and may use that data for product improvement and training.
3. How do you protect my content and data?
We take robust steps to protect all of our users and their data, with industry-leading security, privacy, and responsible AI measures. If a user allows Grammarly to use their content for product improvement and training, all sampled content is de-identified (removing any association to the identity of a user), sanitized (removing sensitive data such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or email addresses), and other identifiable content is replaced with random values—for example, the name “Christopher Pike” is replaced with “John Doe.”
4. What if I am an admin located in the European Union (EU) or UK, or I have users in my institution who live in the EU or UK?
We do not train on any organization content from users whose account originates in the EU, UK, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland, regardless of the setting of this control.
5. How does my Product Improvement and Training setting change if I leave a Grammarly Business account and become a Free user?
If a user leaves a Grammarly Team or Pro account and becomes a Free user, the Product Improvement and Training control will keep the setting it had when they were a member of the Business account. The Product Improvement and Training toggle will be visible to the user and modifiable if they wish to change that setting.
Users in the EU, UK, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland will never see the Product Improvement and Training control because it always remains off.
6. How does my Product Improvement and Training setting change if I’ve converted from an Enterprise, Education, or other Grammarly Business plan purchased through Sales to another paid Grammarly account?
For accounts that were previously on Grammarly’s Enterprise plan or other plans purchased through Grammarly’s Sales team, the Product Improvement and Training control will remain off, with no toggle visible to modify the setting, meaning that none of the organization’s content will be used to train Grammarly’s models or improve its products.
For further questions, please contact your sales representative or
customer support.

What is the Product Improvement and Training control?
The Product Improvement and Training control determines whether an organization’s content is used by Grammarly to train its models and improve its product for other users. Product improvements include training and validating Grammarly’s AI and machine learning models and general research that informs Grammarly feature development and enhancement.
For all Enterprise-tier accounts and Grammarly Business accounts purchased through Grammarly’s sales team, and all Grammarly for Education accounts, Product Improvement and Training is automatically OFF, meaning Grammarly is not using these organizations’ content to train models or improve its product for other users. For these types of accounts, this setting cannot be changed.

e98a39b169b9,validation,article_0290,Bring Your Own Key FAQ,security_config,Privacy and Security,"What is Grammarly’s enterprise key management solution?
Grammarly offers an enterprise key management solution that consists of two options:
Grammarly-managed key
Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
What is a Grammarly-managed key?
Grammarly-managed keys (GMK) offer application-level encryption and encryption at rest for Grammarly Enterprise accounts utilizing a customer managed key (CMK) in Grammarly’s AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Organizations do not need to set up or maintain the GMK, as this feature is automatically activated for all Grammarly Enterprise customers. You can view the GMK feature on the Grammarly
data settings page
.
What is Bring Your Own Key?
For Grammarly Enterprise customers who want more control and oversight, Grammarly’s BYOK solution allows customers to use their own customer managed key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt and retain control over data stored at rest within Grammarly’s services. Amazon CloudWatch/AWS CloudTrail Logs allow for increased visibility and transparency via detailed logs that show how your data is being accessed within Grammarly’s environment.
How does Grammarly’s BYOK work?
As a Grammarly BYOK customer, you will set up and configure a customer-managed key (CMK) in your AWS Key Management Service (KMS) within your AWS account. You then write and attach a policy that grants permissions for Grammarly’s AWS account, where our Enterprise Key Management Service (EKMS) runs, to access a limited set of permissions on your key. Once these AWS resources have been created, you will provide the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to your Grammarly account team, who will enable BYOK on your Grammarly Business account. This enables Grammarly services to encrypt and decrypt data using your key.
What are the benefits of using Bring Your Own Key?
Encrypt your application-level data at rest:
Have additional reassurance – on top of Grammarly’s already strong security measures – that you exercise full control over who is accessing your data, and when, all run through AWS’s Key Management Service.
Decrypt and Encrypt:
Manage access on a granular level to minimize disruption and ensure authorized access to your data
Audit Logs:
View an audit log in CloudTrail documenting every time Grammarly needs to re-access your key encrypted data, giving you full transparency into data access.
How does BYOK supplement Grammarly’s existing security offerings?
Grammarly utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) for all data processing. Data in transit is protected by up-to-date encryption protocols (TLS 1.2). Data at rest is encrypted using the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm.
Each Grammarly customer’s data is segregated logically from other users’ data. Any writing that an individual or organization reviews with Grammarly will never appear in another customer’s writing suggestions.
Grammarly does not allow Microsoft Azure OpenAI, our LLM provider, to retain any data we send or to use it to train its models. This is contractually prohibited.
Additionally, Grammarly's Product Improvement and Training control is automatically off for all Enterprise-tier Grammarly Business accounts, meaning Grammarly does not use content from those organizations to train its models or improve its product for other users.
How do I set up BYOK?
To configure BYOK, visit the Grammarly
data settings page
to complete the BYOK setup wizard and view the BYOK implementation guide.
For which types of Grammarly accounts is Bring Your Own Key currently available?
BYOK is only available for Enterprise-tier Grammarly Business accounts. Learn more about the different plans we offer here:
Grammarly Plans
.
What data types are encryptable using BYOK?
Your dictionary:
With Grammarly’s personal dictionary feature, users can ensure that unique words in their lexicon are not flagged as misspelled. Words are added to the personal dictionary via the account hub or a Grammarly client by any Grammarly user.
Org dictionary:
Create a custom dictionary of important or unique words for your organization. These words will no longer be flagged as misspellings. Words can be added to the org dictionary by any Grammarly admin, account manager or group manager via the account hub.
Style rules:
The style rules feature allows you to create custom rules around the proper use, spelling, and formatting of specific words, terms, and phrases to ensure team-wide consistency. Style rules can be added to any Rule set via the account hub by admins, account managers, or users.
Knowledge share:
Knowledge Share helps your team members decode terms like acronyms or internal project names by providing tooltip-like explanations—a definition of a term, key contacts, and links to relevant documents. Knowledge share terms can be added by any Grammarly admin, account manager, or group manager via the account hub.
Snippets:
Create custom libraries of common, pre-approved messages for easy use across your teams’ applications and websites that can be easily accessed using Grammarly clients. Org-level snippets can be added to the snippets collection by any Grammarly admin, account manager, or group manager via the account hub. User-level snippets can be added by any user via the account hub. Excludes Snippets folder names.
Grammarly Editor Documents:
Documents created by users using the Grammarly Editor or scratchpad. Users can upload existing documents or write new documents from scratch via the editor or scratch pad.
Grammarly Editor Document metadata:
Document metadata such as title and first 100 characters based on document creation. Metadata is derived from each Grammarly Editor or scratchpad document.
I have BYOK set up and want to leave Grammarly, how can I revoke access to my key?
To revoke your Customer Master Key (CMK) at any time:
Access the AWS KMS console [https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/home]
Find your customer master key.
Edit its policy to change the statement that allows Grammarly key access to deny access.
{
""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
""Statement"": [
{
""Effect"": ""Deny"",
""Principal"": {
""AWS"": ""arn:aws:iam::{your-aws-account-id}:root""
},
""Action"": ""kms:*"",
""Resource"": ""*""
}
]
}
Immediately after this change is made, Grammarly will be denied use of your CMK. Shortly after that, Grammarly’s key cache will expire and no data will be decryptable.

Questions and answers
What are billing groups?
Billing groups provide an additional layer for managing seats on your Grammarly license and allow you to associate members with specific internal budgets. For example, if your organization’s software procurement process involves allocating separate budgets for specific departments or teams, you can reflect this in your Grammarly license by creating corresponding billing groups.
Configuring billing groups for your Grammarly license allows for:
Easier seat distribution and tracking across various departments or budgets within your organization.
Getting seat usage insights by billing departments, empowering you to make informed decisions about seat reallocation, usage optimization, and renewals.
Setting seat limits for billing groups, ensuring that teams or departments in your organization are in full control over their allocated seats.
Seeing the exact date when members joined your Grammarly license.
You can find an overview of your organization's seat usage on the

How to create billing groups
Billing groups can be created automatically based on the cost center attribute passed from an identity provider or manually on the

If you use SAML single sign-on, you can configure the
CostCenter
attribute in your identity provider to automatically create billing groups based on the assigned cost centers.
If a new member’s cost center is associated with an existing billing group, they will be mapped to that billing group automatically. If no corresponding billing group has been created in Grammarly yet, a new billing group will be created based on the member’s cost center.
Members without a cost center attribute in your identity provider will be assigned to your organization’s default billing group. These members can be manually assigned to any of the existing billing groups later from the
Members
page.
How to assign members to billing groups
To assign team members to a billing group, follow these steps:
Go to the
Members
page.
Check the boxes next to team members’ names and click

How to allocate seats for billing groups
If you have enabled SAML single sign-on for your Grammarly license and configured the CostCenter attribute in your identity provider, you can allocate a specific number of seats for your billing groups. Follow these instructions to do so:
Go to the
Billing Groups
page.
Click on the three dots icon
⋮
next to a billing group and select
Allocate seats
:
In the window that opens next, enter the number of seats you’d like to allocate to the billing group and click
Save
.
Optionally, you can switch the toggle next to
Limit billing group to the number of allocated seats
.
You can review seat allocation changes in the
Seat history
section:
To undo seat allocation for a billing group, delete the number of seats you entered in the seat allocation window and click
Save
.
Seat allocation without limiting a billing group to the number of allocated seats
If the number of allocated seats is reached, members with the relevant cost centers can still join your organization’s license and will be mapped to the respective billing group.
In this case, we’ll display a warning next to the billing group on the
Billing Groups
page:
Additionally, an email notification will be sent to all admins of your Grammarly license and the billing group contacts.
Seat allocation with limiting a billing group to the number of allocated seats
If the number of allocated seats is reached, but there are available seats in your organization’s default billing group, new members can still join your organization’s license for 30 days. If the number of allocated seats or the members’ billing group is not changed during this period, the affected members will be removed from the license.
If the number of allocated seats is reached, and there are no available seats in your organization’s default billing group, new members will not be able to join your organization’s license.
Billing group contacts and their permissions
Billing group contacts have the following permissions:
Assign or unassign cost centers to their billing group.
Assign or unassign billing contacts to their billing group.
Add or remove members from their billing group.
Export the list of members of their billing group.
Allocate, edit, or remove the number of available seats for the billing group.
Merge their billing groups into one.
You can assign a billing contact to a billing group while creating the group or by opening an existing group and clicking
Edit permissions
next to
Billing contact
:
Questions and answers
What is the difference between cost centers and billing groups?
Cost centers are the attributes that you can define and assign to members in your identity provider. Cost centers can then be mapped to billing groups in your Grammarly license.
For example, a “Marketing team” billing group can have three cost centers assigned to it: “Digital marketing,” “Product marketing,” and “Content marketing.” In this case, members who have the “Digital marketing” cost center assigned to them in the identity provider will be mapped to the “Marketing team” billing group.
Can a team member be part of more than one billing group?
No, a team member can be assigned to only one billing group.
Is there a maximum number of billing groups that an admin can create?
No, there’s no limit to the number of billing groups that can be created.
Can members with a cost center attribute be manually assigned to a billing group?
Members who were assigned a billing group through SAML single sign-on can be manually reassigned to any other billing group from the
Members
page. However, upon their next authentication via SSO, they will be reassigned to the billing group according to their cost center attribute.
If SCIM provisioning is enabled, only members without a cost center assigned in the identity provider can be manually added to a billing group.
If I change the billing group name in Grammarly, will that update my SCIM provisioning settings in the identity provider?
No, billing groups and cost center names are separate.
How can I view a member’s join date?
Open a billing group that the member is part of and check the
Join date
column next to their name and email address:
You can also view the join date on the
Members
page.
Note:
If there is no
Join date
column, click on the
Columns
menu at the top of the member list and check the box next to
Join date

The Effective Communication Score section of the

Overall Effective Communication Score and the Score Breakdown
The overall Effective Communication Score is a holistic score that helps you better understand the quality and performance of your organization’s communication.
To learn how to improve your team’s Effective Communication Score, check out this article:
How can I improve my organization’s Effective Communication Score?
The
Score breakdown
section displays the metrics that contribute to your overall Effective Communication Score:
Clarity:
How clearly and efficiently is your team communicating? This score analyzes the use of Grammarly’s suggestions to make your team’s writing more concise, simpler, and easier to understand.
Inclusivity:
How inclusive is your team’s communication? Help foster a respectful, inclusive workplace by ensuring your team is using language that upholds your company’s values.
Correctness:
Ensure your team’s communications remain mistake-free and strike a professional tone. This score analyzes the use of Grammarly’s suggestions to reduce common communication errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
Style consistency:
How consistent is your team’s writing style? This score analyzes how Grammarly’s suggestions help your team follow your style guide and writing preferences in their communications.
Brand consistency:
How consistently does your team write in one brand voice? This score analyzes how your team follows the tone profiles created for your organization’s unique brand voice.
To examine the data that contributes to your overall score more closely, click
View detailed score analysis
under the score breakdown.
In the
Interpreting your score
section, you can also see your
Industry Benchmark
, which is a valuable reference point for comparing your team's writing score to that of other organizations in your industry.
For each organization in your industry, we calculate their Effective Communication Score without Grammarly and then average these scores. This creates a benchmark that reflects typical writing performance in your industry.
Grammarly’s impact on your team’s communication
This score highlights Grammarly’s impact on your team’s communication by comparing the number of mistakes before and after applying Grammarly’s suggestions. It compares the average number of suggestions that Grammarly provides to your team for each metric per 1,000 or 100,000 words and the average number of suggestions that remain unaddressed.
How the score is calculated
Underlying data:
The Effective Communication Score analyzes how often writing suggestions are accepted and the tones detected in your members’ writing. This data allows us to calculate the overall score for your team while focusing on key writing elements: correctness, clarity, inclusivity, and brand and style consistency.
Metric calculation:
Once we’ve grouped the underlying data for all members, we calculate an average score for each metric: Correctness, Clarity, Inclusivity, Brand consistency, and Style consistency. To get a percentile for each score, we compare it against the scores of other Enterprise users for a given period of time.
The final Effective Communication Score
: To get your team’s final Effective Communication Score, we calculate the average of all the metrics: Correctness, Clarity, Inclusivity, Brand consistency, and Style consistency.
Note:
If your organization hasn’t set up any style rules or brand tone profiles, the Brand consistency and Style consistency metrics won’t be included in the calculation of your team’s Effective Communication Score.

Contact Support.
Select an option below to explore the features within the Grammarly companion app:
Manage settings
From the settings, you can make the following adjustments:
Switch Grammarly on or off according to your needs.
Turn on the quick toggle feature. This option allows you to easily switch Grammarly on or off from the notification shade without opening the companion app.
Change your language preferences. Customize Grammarly to suit your regional English dialect, choosing from American (US), Australian (AU), British (UK), Canadian (CA), or Indian (IN) English.
Manage Appearance
You can customize how the Grammarly widget displays suggestions and alerts.
In the
Active
tab, you can change the appearance of the Grammarly widget. You have the following options:
Customize the widget size.

This is a dedicated space for drafting quick notes and messages or preparing content. This feature allows meticulous editing before you transfer your polished text to other applications.

Starting a new draft is intuitive. Simply tap
Add New,
and you’re set to begin typing or pasting text from your clipboard for editing.
When you’re finished editing, tap the copy icon to effortlessly copy your refined text to the clipboard, ready to be pasted into any desired location or application.
If you wish to declutter by removing any specific draft, tapping the bin icon will instantly delete the selected draft.

What’s new?
As we strive to provide robust, insights-driven analytics on your team’s writing with Grammarly, we made the following enhancements to the
Team overview
page:
1. Introduced the Effective Communication Score for Enterprise teams:
The Effective Communication Score represents the overall strength of your organization’s communication. By surfacing key metrics, Grammarly can show you where teams are doing well—and where they can improve. You can learn more in this article:
Introducing the Effective Communication Score
2. Added a chart to display data on application and domain usage
Added a new chart:
Where Your Members Are Using Grammarly
. This chart shows the top 10 applications and websites where your team members are writing with Grammarly. Additionally, you can filter the results to view where your team members are using Grammarly’s generative AI.
Note:
At this time, the application and website data can’t be filtered by a user group or other criteria.
3. The “Active Team Members” chart replaced with the “Grammarly Usage Summary” chart
The new
Grammarly Usage Summary
chart provides a breakdown of Grammarly usage within your organization. It allows you to compare the following values over time:
Number of users who are connected to Grammarly
Number of users who are writing while Grammarly is connected
Number of users who accepted Grammarly suggestions while they wrote with Grammarly connected
How to read this chart?
In an optimal scenario, all three lines on the chart should closely align with each other. If there is a noticeable distance between any of the lines, it may be a good opportunity to promote the use of Grammarly within your organization.
Note:
You can send reminders to team members with pending invitations by clicking
Remind Invited
in the right-side panel. This option will appear only to team members with the admin role and if the data filter is set to

The data from the
Grammarly Usage Summary

Once a team member is removed, their data will not be taken into account for the entire time period.
Applying filters
Note:
This feature is not available to team members with the user role. Team members with the group manager permissions will be able to apply filters only for the selected groups they have permission to manage. Custom group filter functionality is not available to group managers.
You can filter analytics data by a
user group
or create a custom filter.
To filter by a user group, click
All members
at the top of the page and select the box next to a group.
To create a custom filter:
Open the filters dropdown menu.
Click
Create custom filter
:
Enter the filter name and select the boxes next to the team members you’d like to include (minimum of 2, maximum of 1,000).
Click

Note:
You can create up to a maximum of 30 filters.
While any users with the admin or account manager role can filter by user groups, custom filters won’t be visible to other team members. You can also combine any number of filters by user group and custom filters in the same query:
When team members are added to a custom filter or a user group, their data will be included for the entire time period they have been a part of the subscription and not just since the day they were added to the filter or group.
Note:
If a member is included in several groups, they will be accounted for only once in aggregated statistics and graphs.
To edit or delete a custom filter, open the filters dropdown menu and click on the pencil icon next to a filter:
Setting the date range
You can choose to view the data for the previous 7 days, the previous 30 days, or for a custom date range.
You can only choose dates starting from April 1, 2021.
The date format is YYYY/MM/DD.
For date ranges of 30 days or less, data will be grouped by day. For date ranges between 31 and 180 days, data will be grouped by week. For longer date ranges, data will be grouped by month.
If the date range can’t be broken down into a whole number of weeks, the last data point will show an incomplete week.
Here’s how data will be grouped into 7-day and 30-day blocks depending on the graph:
Writing Sessions Improved:
Percentage of improved sessions over the time period
Grammarly Suggestions:
View by totals:
The total value over the entire time period
View by percentage:
Percentage of the total number of suggestions that were accepted
View per 100 words:
The average number of suggestions per 100 words over the time period
Tones Detected:
The average percentages of tones used per day. The number of writing sessions during a day is not taken into account when calculating the average over a time period. For example, if Grammarly detected that 50 percent of your writing was in a friendly tone on day one, and 25 percent was in a friendly tone on day two, the resulting number for two days would be (50+25)/2=37.5 percent regardless of how much text you wrote on either day

Grammarly Enterprise and Grammarly for Education plans
The Writing Score API allows organizations to evaluate the quality of individual written documents by receiving an overall Grammarly score, as well as separate scores in four categories: engagement, correctness, tone, and clarity. The Writing Score API is available through the HTTP REST interface, enabling organizations to build custom applications that integrate seamlessly with Grammarly.
How it works
The Writing Score API receives a document and extracts the text from it. The extracted text is initially assumed to be 100% correct. Grammarly then generates writing suggestions in four categories: engagement, correctness, tone, and clarity. The suggestions are then prioritized and weighted. Finally, Grammarly calculates a score based on the suggestions and subtracts that score from the original 100% score. The resulting score is returned in the response to the API request.
Note:
Supported document types are DOC, DOCX, ODT, TXT, and RTF.
Here’s an example of what a custom-built application that uses the Writing Score API might look like:
Getting started with the Writing Score API
The Writing Score API is included in Grammarly Enterprise and Grammarly for Education plans.

The API is intended for programmatic consumption and is accessible through an HTTP REST interface. Access to the API requires authentication using an Access Token provided by Grammarly’s OAuth functionality. You can learn more about OAuth credentials in this article:

If you’re the owner of one of the supported Samsung devices and updated to One UI 4.0, Grammarly suggestions are automatically integrated into your Samsung Keyboard, and you will have an opportunity to sign up for a 90-day free trial of Grammarly if you meet the requirements below.
This article covers:
Eligibility requirements
Frequently asked questions
Eligibility requirements
This free-trial offering is available to Samsung users who meet the following criteria:
Have never had a paid Grammarly subscription
Have not previously signed up for this free trial
Use the Samsung Keyboard on one of the compatible devices updated to One UI 4.0
Sign up for their free trial through the Samsung Keyboard
To start the free trial, ensure that
Grammarly is activated
on your device and then tap on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the keyboard, and tap the Grammarly icon on a suggestion card.
If you don’t have access to or are not eligible for the free trial, you can still use the
free version of Grammarly
that includes essential Grammarly functionality or
upgrade your account
.
Frequently asked questions
Am I eligible for the trial if I use the Grammarly Keyboard for Android?
This free-trial offering is specifically designed for users of the Samsung Keyboard on select Samsung devices who have not previously had a Grammarly subscription. If this does not apply to you, you can still take advantage of Grammarly’s features by creating a
free individual account
.
I meet the eligibility requirements for this offering, but I have already paid for a Grammarly subscription. Can I get a refund?
If you previously purchased one of Grammarly's paid subscription plans, you are not eligible for this free trial offering.
If I have a few Samsung devices that meet the eligibility requirements, am I eligible for multiple free trials?
Not at this time. Qualifying Samsung users are eligible for this free trial of Grammarly once, regardless of the number of devices they currently own.
I signed up for a trial, but my credit card was charged. What do I do?
Here are some reasons why your card may have been charged if you signed up for this free trial:
You might see a $1 USD charge on your statement. This is the minimum charge we can apply against a card for validation of both the card and our ability to transact against it for your subscription. It is only temporary and isn’t actually withdrawn, so it will appear as a “Pending” transaction before eventually going away.
You might see a renewal charge if your 90-day free trial expired before you canceled your subscription.
You might have signed up from a different device. Currently, the free trial is available to Samsung Keyboard users with eligible Samsung devices where Grammarly suggestions have been integrated automatically.
If the charge you see on your statement doesn’t correspond to any of the cases mentioned above, please reach out to our Support team by submitting a ticket
here

To learn more, check out this article:
Introducing the Effective Communication Score
This article provides guidelines for how you can increase your team’s Effective Communication Score and maximize your team’s engagement with Grammarly, ensuring that you and your team members fully leverage the available features.
Ways to optimize your team’s use of Grammarly’s writing features:
Review and update your organization’s
style rules
, and ensure team members are assigned to the relevant style rule sets. When creating or editing style rules, you can leverage the
extended functionality
that allows you to create more precise and contextually aware rules.
Revise and update your organization’s
brand tone profile
, or create separate tone profiles for different user groups.
Set organizational
writing preferences
to customize Grammarly’s suggestions for your team’s writing style. You can specify writing preferences in several categories, such as:
inclusive language
punctuation
sentence clarity
Add terms to your
organizational dictionary
to stop Grammarly from flagging specific spellings as incorrect. This helps ensure that Grammarly offers only relevant suggestions for your team. Additionally, you can encourage your team members to use the
personal dictionary
feature to add their own unique terms to their accounts.
Set a
preferred dialect
for your team to ensure consistency across the organization.
Create
snippets
to save time and ensure accuracy for bits of text that your organization uses often.
Encourage your team members to review and accept writing suggestions. Grammarly’s core writing suggestions are organized into four categories to help you understand the reasoning behind each suggestion: correctness, clarity, delivery, and engagement. For more information about the writing feedback you and your team members can receive, check out this article:
How do I check text?

Send
email invitations
.
Set up SSO
for your subscription and ensure all members have
access to the Grammarly app

Grammarly for Windows or Mac
