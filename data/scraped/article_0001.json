  "content": "Tax and tax exemption\nTo ensure our services are legally compliant in each country, Grammarly may charge applicable taxes based on your billing address. The tax amount may be indicated on the checkout page as a separate fee or included in the subscription price. In the latter case, Grammarly will remit it to the tax authority, but it may still appear as a separate amount on your bank statement or PayPal account.\nDoes Grammarly accept tax exemptions?\nWe do not currently accept tax exemptions for individual Grammarly Pro and Grammarly Premium plans, including purchases on behalf of tax-exempt institutions or made using payment methods owned by such institutions.\nGrammarly can only accept tax exemption requests for team plans that meet a specific size threshold. Tax exemption can only be granted after the purchase has been completed.",
