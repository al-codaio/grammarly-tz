  "content": "The design of the sidebar was changed as a part of a product update. Instead of seeing the sidebar with all suggestions at once, you will see one suggestion at a time after clicking the Grammarly icon:\nNote:\nThis interface is also available through Grammarly for Windows and Mac. To learn more about this product offering, check out\nthis article\n.\nHow to check text\nWhen you click on a text field, you should see Grammarly’s logo in the lower-right corner. As you start typing, Grammarly will begin to check your text dynamically, and the Grammarly icon will spin:\nNote:\nGrammarly does not initialize in text areas smaller than 38 px in height.\nWhen Grammarly finishes checking the text, the icon in the lower-right corner of the text field will show the number of suggestions. Some of our suggestions appear as underlines in the text. To accept a suggestion, hover over the underlined text and click the card that appears.\nIf Grammarly flags an unfamiliar word, and you’re sure it’s spelled correctly, you can either ignore the suggestion or add the word to your personal dictionary.\nOther suggestions can be accessed by clicking the Grammarly icon or number in the lower-right corner of your text field. This will open a floating suggestion card, which you can position anywhere on the screen.\nIf you are experiencing an issue with the product, please submit a ticket by following\nthis link\n, and our Support team will be happy to assist you promptly!",
