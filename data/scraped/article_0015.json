  "content": "As a part of our recent update to Grammarly for Windows and Mac, the view of suggestions in applications typically used for longer documents was replaced with a list view of suggestions.\nWith this view, you can review all suggestions in a list, instead of going through them one by one. At this time, the option to switch to the previous interface in these specific apps is not available.\nThe list view of suggestions is currently available in Microsoft Word, Pages, Word Online, Confluence, Notion, Scrivener, Medium, Ulysses, iAWriter, and Substack.",
