  "content": "While you’re writing with Grammarly, Grammarly analyzes your text in real time to provide suggestions. Grammarly also calculates the statistics you see in your Weekly Writing Update email. These calculations (such as number of words written) remain linked to your account, but the text that you wrote does not (unless it is a document you’ve saved in the Grammarly Editor). This calculation is updated continuously throughout the week as you write more text with Grammarly.",
