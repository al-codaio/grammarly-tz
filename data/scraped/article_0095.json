  "content": "WebSockets have been a long time coming. They allow for truly live content to be displayed on web pages as if they were dynamic applications. Grammarly’s server accepts only these kinds of connections, allowing clients to be embedded within the website to connect to Grammarly.\nTo test whether you have WebSockets connections in your browser, go to\nhttps://app.grammarly.com/diagnostic-test\nDoes anything in your test results say\nFailed\n? That might be the root of the problem. Several\nthings may prevent WebSockets from working or may block them entirely:\nOlder browsers\nSome download managers\nSome mobile carriers\nSome firewalls\nSome antivirus software\nSome Internet service providers\nStrict configurations on routers\nSoftware that blocks WebSockets by default:\nZoneAlarm Firewall (Adding exceptions for Grammarly does not help. Even if you turn it off, it will continue to block Grammarly until it is uninstalled.)\nAVG\nAvast\nBitdefender\nIObit Malware Fighter\nInternet Download Manager\nSuperfish VisualDiscovery\nAvira Browser Safety\nBrowser Guard\nPokki\nSmart Panel\nIf one of these programs is installed on your computer, this might prevent you from establishing the connection with Grammarly’s server.\nIf none of these programs are installed on your computer but you are still experiencing issues related to your network configuration, we encourage you to get in touch with your network administrator and ask them to check out the following articles on troubleshooting the issue:\nWebSockets Support Q&A for System Administrators",
