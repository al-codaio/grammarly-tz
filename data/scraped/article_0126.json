The fee is prorated based on the remaining days in the current subscription period.\nIf you accidentally invited additional members, remove them from your plan on the\nMembers\npage and\ncontact Support\nfor further assistance.\nNote:\nCurrently, Grammarly does not issue automatic refunds when a member is removed from a team plan.",
