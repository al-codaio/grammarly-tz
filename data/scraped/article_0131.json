  "title": "Why was I charged during a free trial?",
  "content": "If you signed up for a seven-day free trial of a paid Grammarly plan, you will not be charged before your free trial ends.\nIf your free trial hasn’t ended yet, but there’s a pending transaction on your credit card statement, it is most likely a verification charge. This transaction is meant to validate your payment method and our ability to transact against it for your subscription. It is only temporary and should appear as “Pending” on your statement. Later, it will either be removed if you cancel your subscription or replaced by the actual charge if you choose to keep your subscription.\nIf you’d like to cancel your subscription to prevent any scheduled payments, please follow the steps outlined in this article:\nCancel my subscription",
