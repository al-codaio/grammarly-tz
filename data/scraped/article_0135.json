  "content": "Grammarly for Nonprofits and NGOs, an initiative that offered free access to key Grammarly Business features to qualifying nonprofits and NGOs, ended on May 1, 2024.\nWe started this initiative four years ago as a temporary response to the global pandemic, as a way to support the sector’s critical work during an especially challenging time, and we’re proud to have been able to do this.\nWe believe this program has met its goal of supporting nonprofits and NGOs through the crisis, so we have discontinued it on May 1, 2024.\nAs a result, we no longer accept applications for Grammarly for Nonprofits and NGOs.\nWe encourage you to use Grammarly Free, which includes free access to critical grammar and spelling suggestions, our tone detector, generative AI, and correctness and clarity writing dimensions in the Grammarly Editor. You can also review your writing statistics and track your progress through our weekly progress report emails.",
