  "content": "With the beta version of Grammarly’s tone suggestions, users of our paid subscription plans can accept tone suggestions for individual sentences to make their writing sound more personable, positive, and confident.\nThis feature is available in Grammarly for Windows and Mac, the Grammarly Editor, and the Grammarly browser extension.\nNote:\nGrammarly’s tone detector, which identifies the overall tone of your text rather than offering suggestions for individual sentence rewrites, is available in Grammarly for Windows and Mac, the Grammarly browser extension, the Grammarly Keyboard, and Grammarly for Android. For more information on the tone detector, visit\nthis page\n.\nTo learn more about Grammarly’s tone suggestions, check out\nthis blog article\n.",
