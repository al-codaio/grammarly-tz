  "content": "Your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel it before the end of the billing period.\nDepending on your subscription, Grammarly will charge you monthly, quarterly, or annually on the date you\npurchased your subscription\n. If your billing date falls on a date that does not occur in a given month, you’ll be billed on the last day of that month instead. Charges are billed at the beginning of your billing cycle and may take a few days to appear on your statement.\nTo check your next billing date and the current or queued subscription, go to the\nSubscription\npage.\nNote:\nIf you see charges on a new card that you haven’t added to your Grammarly account, it’s likely because your financial institution has automatically updated your billing details. This is to ensure that accounts using recurring payments remain in good standing when a new card is issued. In some cases, recurring charges may be allowed on an expired card. If you have any concerns about this process, please contact your financial institution.",
