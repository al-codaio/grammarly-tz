  "content": "When you paste a document into the Grammarly iPhone Editor, some formatting, such as pictures and tables, may not be imported successfully.\nAs a workaround, if you are writing your text in any other text processor, you can take advantage of the Grammarly Keyboard and check the text directly in that text processor.\nNote:\nIf there are certain formatting options that you would like to see included within the Grammarly iPhone Editor, we would love to hear about them. Please submit any feedback\nhere\n.",
