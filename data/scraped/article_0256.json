  "content": "Included in:\nGrammarly Enterprise and Grammarly for Education plans\nThe Writing Score API allows organizations to evaluate the quality of individual written documents by receiving an overall Grammarly score, as well as separate scores in four categories: engagement, correctness, tone, and clarity. The Writing Score API is available through the HTTP REST interface, enabling organizations to build custom applications that integrate seamlessly with Grammarly.\nHow it works\nThe Writing Score API receives a document and extracts the text from it. The extracted text is initially assumed to be 100% correct. Grammarly then generates writing suggestions in four categories: engagement, correctness, tone, and clarity. The suggestions are then prioritized and weighted. Finally, Grammarly calculates a score based on the suggestions and subtracts that score from the original 100% score. The resulting score is returned in the response to the API request.\nNote:\nSupported document types are DOC, DOCX, ODT, TXT, and RTF.\nHere’s an example of what a custom-built application that uses the Writing Score API might look like:\nGetting started with the Writing Score API\nThe Writing Score API is included in Grammarly Enterprise and Grammarly for Education plans.\nInterested in upgrading to an Enterprise account?\nContact our Sales team\n.\nThe API is intended for programmatic consumption and is accessible through an HTTP REST interface.
