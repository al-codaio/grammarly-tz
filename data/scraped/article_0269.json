  "content": "If you would like to view or re-insert text from a previous prompt, simply tap the clock icon at the top of the Grammarly pop-up:\nWhen you open your prompt history, you will only see prompts you used in the application or on the website where you're currently working. In other words, you won’t see the prompts you’ve used in Microsoft Word when you open the prompt history in Gmail. Also, you will only be able to access prompts that were generated on the device you are currently using.\nNote:\nIf you don’t want Grammarly to save your prompts, you can switch off\nshow recent prompt history\nin the\nFeature customization\nsection of your Grammarly settings.",
