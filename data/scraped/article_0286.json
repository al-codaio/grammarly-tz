  "content": "No. A keylogger is a type of malicious software or surveillance tool that records every keystroke typed on a keyboard without the user’s knowledge. The captured data—such as passwords or personal information—is often sent to a third party for purposes like identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access. Grammarly’s product doesn’t fit any of these descriptions.\nAt Grammarly, we value user trust and operate with high standards for privacy and transparency.
