Please try to resolve it by turning them off (click\nhere\nfor more details on this). We encourage you to get in touch with your network administrator and ask them to enable a specific web socket port.\nYour network administrator can check out the following article on how to troubleshoot the issue:\nWebSockets Support Q&A for System Administrators\nIf that doesn't work for you, please try to log in to Grammarly from another location (office, home, Internet caf√©, or using 3G/4G modem) where the Internet provider is different.",
