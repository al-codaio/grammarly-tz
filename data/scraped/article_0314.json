  "title": "Session Timeout FAQ",
  "content": "Session Timeout is a setting that provides a mechanism for organizations to ensure that their users are regularly re-authenticating their identity in order to continue using Grammarly.\nAdmins can select a time interval in units of days (i.e., 14 days, 30 days).\nWhat are the benefits of using Session Timeout?\nSession Timeout protects your organization’s account from unwanted account takeovers. Periodic forced re-authentication means reducing the time window when an attacker can gain unauthorized access to an account.\nAdditionally, Session Timeout ensures regular re-engagement for accounts using SaaS spend optimization platforms, showing more accurate account usage insights for users who might otherwise be inadvertently de-provisioned.\nFor which types of Grammarly accounts is Session Timeout currently available?\nSession Timeout is only available to Grammarly Business Enterprise and Grammarly for Education accounts. Reach out to your sales representative or contact us\nhere\nif you are interested in upgrading to an Enterprise account.\nHow can I configure Session Timeout for my organization?\nSession Timeout can only be configured by Grammarly’s Enterprise sales team at this time. Please reach out to your sales or customer success representative if you are interested in enabling Session Timeout for your organization.\nWhat time interval is recommended for Session Timeout?\nOur default recommendation is a 30-day timeout window for most organizations, but Session Timeout can be configured to fit your organization’s needs.",
