  "content": "Grammarly works in tandem with your operating system to provide feedback about your writing across a wide range of supported apps on your mobile device. To offer this experience, Grammarly needs access to Accessibility features on your device. Without this access, our product will not be able to provide writing assistance.\nBe assured that Grammarly only analyzes your text and provides suggestions in the text field you are writing in. When Grammarly isn't active, the floating Grammarly widget becomes semi-transparent, meaning that Grammarly isn't accessing your text at that moment. Grammarly does not collect or analyze text outside the text field you are writing in.\nYou can read about our enterprise-grade security and commitment to trust at\nhttps://www.grammarly.com/trust",
