In most cases, this happens implicitly as part of the sign-in process.\nIn order to link a social account to your Grammarly account, please select Google, Facebook, or Apple at\nhttps://www.grammarly.com/signin\n. Keep in mind that your social accounts need to be associated with the same email address that your Grammarly account was registered with.\nOnce linked, you can manage accounts within the\nAccount\npage. You can view the currently linked accounts and unlink them if needed.\nNote:\nIf you registered using Google, Facebook, or Apple, you can set a password for your account by following\nthese steps\n.",
