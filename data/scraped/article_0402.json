When you're using Grammarly for Windows and Mac, you can see this list view in apps and websites that are typically used for writing longer documents.\nAt this time, the list view of suggestions is available in Microsoft Word, Pages, Word Online, Confluence, Notion, Scrivener, Medium, Ulysses, iA Writer, and Substack. However, we are constantly evaluating our product offerings, and we may include more apps and websites in the future.",
