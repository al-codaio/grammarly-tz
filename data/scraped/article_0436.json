  "content": "If you’re an admin of a team plan, a writing preference may appear locked by the admin if you’re attempting to adjust your personal writing preferences rather than your team’s preferences.\nTo customize your team’s writing preferences, go to the\nWriting Preferences\npage.\nIf you’re not an admin, then a writing preference locked by the admin means that the person managing your team’s preferences has set this specific preference for your entire team or member group. We suggest you contact your admin for more information. You can find their contact information on the\nSubscription\npage.",
