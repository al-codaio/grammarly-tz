  "content": "If you suspect someone is paying for a Grammarly subscription using your payment method without your consent, or if you do not recognize charges coming from Grammarly, please\ncontact us\nimmediately.\nAt Grammarly, we take fraud, identity theft, and other unauthorized access very seriously. We can immediately cancel any such subscription and block any further Grammarly charges to your credit card or PayPal account.\nRequests for further information for prosecution purposes must be submitted by a law enforcement agency.\nNote:\nIf you see charges on a new card that you haven’t added to your Grammarly account, it’s likely because your financial institution has automatically updated your billing details. This is to ensure that accounts using recurring payments remain in good standing when a new card is issued. In some cases, recurring charges may be allowed on an expired card. If you have any concerns about this process, please contact your financial institution.",
