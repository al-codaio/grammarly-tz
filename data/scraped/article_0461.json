  "content": "With the release of iPadOS 17, Apple has changed how you interact with external keyboards and switch between various keyboards. Since this change falls under Apple's domain, our options to address it directly are limited.\nAs a workaround, you can switch to the Grammarly Keyboard by tapping the\nShow keyboard\nwhile your external keyboard is active, and then tapping the onscreen globe icon to switch the keyboard to Grammarly.\n​​\nYou can also submit a bug report to Apple so that the team is aware of this issue. Here is how to submit a bug report to Apple:\nGo to\nApple's feedback page\nand choose\niPad\n.\nFill in the form and provide details about the issue, including the specific problems with the\nGlobe\nkey and the Grammarly Keyboard when using the Apple Magic Keyboard on iPadOS 17 or newer.\nSend your feedback to notify Apple of the issue.",
