  "content": "If you see charges on a new card that you haven’t added to your Grammarly account, it’s likely because your financial institution has automatically updated your billing details. This is to ensure that accounts using recurring payments remain in good standing when a new card is issued. In some cases, recurring charges may be allowed on an expired card. If you have any concerns about this process, please contact your financial institution.",
